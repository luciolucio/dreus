The Gord, normally a loving Gord and friendly to all, sometimes is forced to lay the hand of justice down upon those who would seek unrest and are unjust.  Let their hallowed cries serve as a warning to those who would seek not to be vanquished by the Gord, our Gord!

Doomed are those who seek to challenge the authority of the Gord!

You shall fear the Gord, your Gord; you shall serve him and cleave to him, and by his name you shall swear. He is your praise; he is your Gord, who has done for you these great and terrible things which your eyes have seen.
