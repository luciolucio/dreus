Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.  Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.

For here are the words of wisdom of the Gord.

Proclamations: Chapter 1
Wherein The Gord had written his thoughts on the GameCube.

Proclamations: Chapter 2
Wherein The Gord challenges a false truth!

Proclamations: Chapter 3
Wherein The Gord will empower me to finish this section.

The next Chapter of Proclamations should be up in a day or so.  So we can only hope...  11/18/01

 

Go near and listen to all that the Gord, our Gord, says. Then tell us whatever the Gord, our Gord, tells you. We will listen and obey. Go forth, and speak of Gord's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that Gord destined for our glory before time began
