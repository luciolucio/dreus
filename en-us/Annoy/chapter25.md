Chapter Twenty-Five


Slinkee

“What are you doing?”

“I’m making stairs out of the game cases for your Slinkee to walk down. Again.”

“Why did you pull down so many cases off the wall to do that?”

“I didn’t. They’re from the game rentals you haven’t bothered to put back up on the wall for the last week.”

“Week? Lies. A day. Maybe two.”

“Shouldn’t you put them back on the wall when people rent them? You know, like a real game store.”

“Shouldn’t you be in school?”

“If you force me to answer, I’ll just lie and tell you no.”

“Well, just don’t break those cases. You know how hard they are to replace?”

“Don’t you have a thousand spares in the back?”

“Three hundred rounded to the nearest thousand is zero.”
"With luck, we won't need them.  Rock on, Slinkee"

Sadly, the VM Labs super slinky was not long for this world, and eventually was mortally wounded in an unfortunate accident in the back of the store.

 

Over an Open Fire

"That's a pretty good painting on the side of the fridge."

"Send your thanks to the artist. I had very little to do with it."

"But I thought you didn't like Pokemon. Why do you have a Pokemon roasting marshmellows over a fire with a cute girl?"

"It's not a Pokemon. It's simply a monsterish creature."

"Are you sure? Hang on, I'll check it again."

<customer walks back to the fridge, then returns>

"Gord?"

"Yes?"

"Why is the campfire in the painting being fuelled by Nintendo 64?"

"Actually, the fire is consuming a Nintendo 64. And a Zelda catridge. It's a lovely picture, isn't it?"




TV Opportunities

"What video game systems do you rent?"

"Pretty much everything released in the last five years."

"And how much to rent the TV?"

"You can play games in the back for no charge. Help yourself."

"I meant to take the TV home."

"..."

"..."

"No. It's not something one can rent to take home."

"Please? It's my son's birthday tomorrow."

"I don't believe you've thought this through. Don't you own a Honda Accord? How would you possibly transport it?"

"Does that mean you'll rent it out?"

"No."
 

Foreshadowing Again

<ring>
"Gamer's Edge"

"May I speak to the manager please?"

"Speaking."

"Yes.  I was phoning to report my ID was stolen and the person has been using it to open accounts to steal games and movies."

"Very well, what is your name."

<customer provides name>

"We don't have an account here with that name.  But I will mark it down to prevent anyone from using your ID."

"Thanks."

Gord types into the computer beside the account name and number:

Identification stolen.  Phone when driver's licence turns up.  Grab the licence and beat the person.

Sadly, the person never did try to use the stolen ID.
