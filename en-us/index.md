Ah Gordâ€¦ Who is this Gord? Well, let me tell you about Gord.

I took it upon myself to bring the slobbering masses into my embrace, and occasionally one aspiring demigod stood above the rest, and proved himself worthy of the name Owner. One of my most promising Keepers of the Retail Faith was The Gord. "Go," I said unto The Gord. "Go, and continue to give to the masses what they so richly deserve!" And he did.

But the story was not yet over. For some time The Gord and I concurrently kept The Retail Faith. His Establishment maintained, surpassed and soon eclipsed mine in sheer Consumer Idiocy. Tales were told that begged disbelief. "No one," we thought, "Is really that stupid." But the stories continued, and the cries of the wretched grew louder and more plentiful. The stories were true: The Gord had become an Owner in Hell. Witness after Witness held forth tales of lunacy and mental vacuousness.

And when I travelled from the hallowed halls of my Game Store and visited the Game Store of The Gord, the truth became apparent. I have no cause to disbelieve the veracity of the tales told here. The truth, it would certainly seem, is contained herein. Go now, and read of The Gord, and know that he has walked the path of the Game Store Owner, and that he has suffered for all of us.

I knew him as Gord.  These were his stories.
