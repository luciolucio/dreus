Chapter Sixteen


Deflation

<ring>

"Gamer's Edge"

"I'd like to find out what some of my games are worth in trade."

"Sure."

<customer lists off games, Gord compiles prices, gives breakdown and then total.>

"That's it?  $95?!"

"Well, most of your games are of low resale value and sell for $20 new.  You've only got one that's really 'good' in terms of reselling quickly."

"You're a rip-off!"

"You're welcome to your opinion, even if it is wrong."

"I'm going to your competition!  They'll give me more."

"You do that."

"Gamer's Edge"

"Yes, I phoned a few minutes ago.  You quoted me $95 for some game trades."

"That is true, but now it's worth $88."

"WHY?"

"Because I can.  Obviously since you're calling back, you were offered less from everyone else.  So I conclude that I can give you less now."

"But you offered $95!"

"And you called me a rip-off.  I'm far above petty theft.  If I was going to enter the criminal underworld, I'd be one of the masterminds."

"What does that mean?"

"That means you'll get $88 for your games."

"I'm never dealing with you again!"

<2 hours later>

<customer walks in and looks at used games.  He then chooses one for $49 and one for $39, totaling $88>

"I'd like to trade these games in please and buy these 2 games please."

"Very well then.  That'll be 10 cents please."

"What?!"

"You're games are worth $87.90 in trade."

"But you said $88!"

"I say a lot of things."

"Why are you doing this to me?"

"Because you annoyed me.  Perhaps if you had been more polite, all this could have been avoided."

<dramatic pause>

"That'll be ten cents please."
