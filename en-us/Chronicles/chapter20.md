Chapter Twenty


The Phantom Memory

"Do you have any of the new Zelda 64's in?"

"Yes I do."

"I'll take one."

"Do you have a memory expansion?"

"What's that?"

"That's the doohickey that doubles the systems RAM.  You need it to run the new Zelda."

"Do you have any used ones?"

"No.  Only new ones."

"I'll see if I can find a used one."

<customer leaves>

<customer returns the next day>

"I'm back.  I bought a used memory expansion."

"I see."

(why tell Gord that you just spent money elsewhere for a used item when he sells them new?  -ed)

"But I only have enough money left for Perfect Dark.  So I'll take one of those."

"Very well then.  That'll be $40."

"How much of the game can run without a memory expansion?"

"It lists it on the back what will and won't run.  But didn't you just say you bought a memory expansion and that's why you don't have enough money for Zelda?"

"Uhmâ€¦."

"You know, I don't recall kicking you in the head."
