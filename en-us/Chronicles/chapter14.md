Chapter Fourteen


Price Match?

"Do you price match?"

On some stuff.  Depends on what it is.

"Microplay has a used copy of Tekken 2 for $15."

"That would be one more copy than I have."

"But you have a new copy for $20."

"Yes, yes I do."

"Will you price match?"

"Not following here."

"Will you sell me that copy of Tekken 2 for $15?"

"Why would I do that?"

"Because Microplay has a used copy for $15."

"I seeâ€¦ so I should price match their used game prices with my new game prices?"

"Yes."

"Sure, what the hell.  While I'm at it, I'll price match my new games to my used ones.  Pass me the price gun, I'll start with Gran Turismo 2.  Sells new for $30, used for $24.  Now they will all be $24!  What a deal!  New and used, hand in hand at the same prices!  The masses will love me!  Why did I not think of this before?"

<Dramatic pause>

"Oh wait, that would be because it's one of the stupidest ideas I've ever heard.  Good thing you don't work here or I would have to fire you.  Used stuff damn well better cost less than new."

<pause>

"So that's $15 plus tax?"

Gord reaches up and pulls down the copies of Tekken 2 and places them in a drawer. 

"I'm sorry, I'm sold out of Tekken 2's.  Sold the last ones just as we were talking."

"But I want one at $15."

"Then I suggest you go to Microplay.  I hear they have a used one for $15."

"But I want a new one."

"Perhaps you should suggest your theory of price matching new product to used pricing.  They might go for it."

"You just lost a sale!"

"Oh no!  I lost a sale on which I would have lost money!  However do I stay in business?"
