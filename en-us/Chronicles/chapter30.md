Chapter Thirty


Another Simple Plan

<Ring>

"Hello?"

"James, Gord from Gamer's Edge.  I'm phoning with regards to Diablo you have currently rented.  It was due back on Monday."

"It was returned."

"No, no it wasn't."

"It was returned on Monday.  My sister returned it for me."

"Have her call me when she gets in."

Gord continues his calling that day.  Eventually he gets to Ryan.

<Ring>

"Hello?"

"Ryan, Gord from Gamer's Edge.  I'm phoning with regards to Bloody Roar you have currently rented.  It was due back on Monday."

"It's been returned."

"No, no it hasn't."

"I gave it to James Henderson to return for me.  He also had a game out he was going to return."

"Well, it never came back."

"How odd" thought Gord that two people were claiming to have returned games that didn't come back, and they both know each other.  Bizarre.

Gord got sidetracked on other matters until a couple weeks later when he is visiting the pawn shop around the corner.  Gord saw the two games that had disappeared.  Gord gets them from the owner as well as the name who sold them.

Lisa Florance.

Seems Lisa got all the way to within a block of the store before deciding she wanted some cash instead of returning the games.

Gord phones up Ryan's mother (the account was in the fathers name, but she could resolve this just as well).  A friendly ultimatum.  Lisa pays, or she can explain it all to the police.

Lisa cracks and comes clean.  Seems she had a speeding ticket she had to pay before her parents found out, just in case they wouldn't let her go on a trip to Mexico she was planning on taking in a couple weeks.

Anyway, Lisa came down, paid the late charges and the money for the pawned games in exchange for not being charged.

Bizarre I say.
