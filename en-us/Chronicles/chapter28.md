Chapter Twenty Eight


A Simple Plan

Customer walks up to Gord.
"So, who runs this place now?"

"That would qualify as my description in the proper context."

"Ah good.  I was hoping we could we could set up the same arrangement as I had with the previous owner."

(previous owner?  There was only one owner, and that was Gord.  -ed)

"Oh, what was this arrangement?"

"I was a big customer of his, so I got all my new games at half price."

"Oh really?"

"Yep.  He loved me.  So, we got a deal?"

"I think we can work something out, what's your name?  I'll make a note on your account."

<customer gives Gord his name, Gord pretends to find the account in the computer database>

"Ok.  Oh, but before I can edit that, we have to take care of some late charges."

"Late charges?"

"Ya, I can't edit the account until it's a zero balance.  Let's see, you're about $430 in arrears."

"What?!"

"$432 actually.  According to the notes, the old owner liked you, so he never brought up the issue of late fees.  But I'm afraid I can't change your account till it's cleared up."

"Uhm, I'll see what I can do."

"Oh, what's your new address?  The one on file was old as we had returned mail."

"I just moved again.  I'll bring, uhm.. I'll bring it in on Friday when I come to pay some of the money I owe."

"Ok, see you then."

Customer never returned.
