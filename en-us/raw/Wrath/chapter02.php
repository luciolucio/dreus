                  On a Friday night, Gord and others were in the store 
                  discussing what their plans were to be, when the idea came 
                  forth.&nbsp; To lay a trap!<p>Traps are always entertaining.&nbsp; 
                  Watching someone look around to decide if the risk is worth 
                  the reward.&nbsp; And tonight, the reward was to be luring 
                  indeed!</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Pass me a dead PlayStation motherboard!&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Here you go.&nbsp; And here's a dead controller port.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Great.&nbsp; Grab a broken system shell too.&nbsp; And 
                  that dead power supply from the top shelf.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>And created was a PlayStation that was 100% defective in 
                  every component except the laser assembly which was missing, 
                  and in its place was a note that read &quot;Congratulations!&nbsp; 
                  You stole a completely non-functional&nbsp; and incomplete 
                  PlayStation.&nbsp; What, did you think that you would find a 
                  perfectly good PlayStation just sitting waiting to be stolen?&nbsp; 
                  Fucking retard.&nbsp; Love, Gamer's Edge.&quot;</p>
                  <p>And outside the clan went!&nbsp; Empty PlayStation boxes 
                  were combined into a little shrine, a shrine to the 
                  PlayStation that would set atop the stack.&nbsp; And to direct 
                  further attention to the stack, several demo CD's were flipped 
                  upside down and pointed to the machine as a giant arrow on the 
                  ground.</p>
                  <p>And a sign was hung above the PlayStation in large letters: 
                  &quot;Please don't steal me.&nbsp; You're being watched.&nbsp; -Mgnt.&quot;</p>
                  <p>To the store they returned, where they then turned off the 
                  lights and engaged in the beauty that was StarCraft.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>From far and wide, the masses stopped and looked.&nbsp; 
                  Walkers stopped and pondered, cars screeched to a halt and backed 
                  up, people walked by the stack over and over.&nbsp; The sign 
                  screamed it was a trap, and yet many looked to see if it truly 
                  was.</p>
                  <p>Finally, one came up to the unit and looked around.&nbsp; 
                  After concluding no one was looking as the store lights were 
                  out and therefore no one must be there, he picked up the 
                  PlayStation.&nbsp; He looked around further, before placing 
                  the unit back down and running away.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the two hour experiment, no one had stolen the unit.</p>
                  <p>How curious.&nbsp; People obey signs that say &quot;don't steal 
                  me&quot; and &quot;hey! I suck! Buy me!&quot;&nbsp; </p>
