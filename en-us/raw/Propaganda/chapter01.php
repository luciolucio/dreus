                  PlayStation work?&nbsp; On a 64 it plugs into the cartridge, but 
                  how does it work on the PlayStation?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Velcro.&quot;<br>

                  <i>&quot;You see, you put the game into the PlayStation like this.&nbsp; 
                  Then you put the GameShark on top of the game, close the lid, 
                  and boom!&nbsp; GameShark action for all.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  The Gord then turned on a machine that was hooked up to the TV 
                  and it looked like the machine that he had set everything in 
                  to was the one being used.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Wow!&nbsp; That's cool!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  And the person then left to tell all his friends.<br>
                  <br>
                  ...two days later…<br>
                  <br>
                  The Gord is working on the computer when the same person comes 
                  in and starts yelling &quot;It doesn't use Velcro!&quot; and storms out.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;That was odd. &quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  It took Gord a few minutes to figure out what buddy meant by 
                  that, and then it dawned on him how he had spun the tale of 
                  Velcro and the GameShark.<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord later learned that this guy had spent the next two days 
                  at school telling everyone who would listen that the 
                  PlayStation GameShark used Velcro.&nbsp; He successfully reinforced 
                  a low intellectual image he had.</font></td>

                  <font face="Times New Roman">As a joke one day Gord started a 
                  story about how Microsoft was bringing out Windows 2000 for 
                  the Dreamcast.&nbsp; It was originally meant for fun among friends 
                  as a case of &quot;wouldn't it be funny if I told people this.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Well, soon enough Gord caved and started telling a couple 
                  people who annoyed him.&nbsp; &quot;You should get Windows 2000 
                  for your Dreamcast.&nbsp; It makes it faster and such.&nbsp; Microplay 
                  has them in stock for $79.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Sure enough they went for it and made a few enquiries for it 
                  from them.&nbsp; As many were curious as to what Microplay had to 
                  say about this sudden influx of people looking for this non 
                  existent product, one of the part timers gave them a call and 
                  asked for it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Do you have Window's 2000 for the Dreamcast?&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;We are currently sold out at the moment.&nbsp; It's no longer 
                  available&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Your web page says you have them for $79.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It does?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Yes.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Well, we could order you in one if you like if you put down a 
                  deposit.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ok, I'll be right down.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Alas, you tell just the right number of idiots a lie, and it 
                  will spread everywhere.&nbsp; And now, we can use this lie on 
                  the Xbox!</font></td>

                  bringing their computers down for some serious StarCraft 
                  action.&nbsp; Well, StarCraft action is always serious, so it's not

                    putting back cases to rented PlayStation 2 games on the 
                    shelf.&nbsp; On the bottom shelf of the PlayStation 2 rental 
                    shelves, someone has placed a copy of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; for the 
                    original Nintendo<br>
                    <br>
                    Gord did the only thing that came to mind.&nbsp; He tagged it 
                    with a rental tag.<br>
                    <br>
                    And for the next two months, people would comment on it.&nbsp; 
                    And when they did, Gord responded that it was a popular 
                    rental, and in fact it was out right now. <br>
                    <br>
                    The bright customers immediately started laughing, as the 
                    cartridge was right there and thought this was quite funny.<br>

                    The not quite so genius customers took a bit longer, but

                    enquiries into the title, failing to realize the &quot;rented
