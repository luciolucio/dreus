                  <font face="Times New Roman">(sadly, the variants of this 
                  conversation have happened far too many times)<br>
                  <br>
                  As mentioned before in Annoyances, Gord has a couple Virtual Boy 
                  headsets by the door on top of a six foot display that are 
                  missing stands as the stands have long since broke. <br>
                  <br>
                  And every month or so, someone comes in on a mission and has to buy one of 
                  them even though they are never going to be able to use it..<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Sell me one.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;They aren't for sale.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Because they are missing a stand.&nbsp; Once you plug in a 
                  controller, they'll just tip.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;But I want one.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Then you'll pay through the nose for one if you can find 
                  one.&nbsp; They are quite rare now.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Sell me one of yours.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Make me an offer?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;What?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Make me an offer.&nbsp; If the offer is high enough, I'll part 
                  with one.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;How about $20?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I'll pass.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;But that's $20!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;True, but I get much more value out of the Virtual Boys 
                  just sitting there than what your $20 could buy.&nbsp; Perhaps for 
                  $50 and you buy six games on top of that, then we can begin discussing my parting with one.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;But I don't want to spend that much.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Then you won't be buying one.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Sell me one!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;No.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;What possible reason would I have for parting with a 
                  fixture that I am going to be unable to replace for a 
                  considerable time, and why would I part with it for a mere 
                  pittance?&nbsp; If I was going to sell it for cheap, they would 
                  have all been sold already.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;What about that one behind the counter?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;My personal one that I never play and I just leave it up 
                  there?&nbsp; Never again to be touched?&nbsp; Never again to be held in 
                  the hands of a loving gamer?&nbsp; A martyr, cast into death before 
                  it's time?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;It's not for sale.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Why won't you sell them!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Because you cannot provide a significant enough interest 
                  in what you are offering in trade.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  And thus he left, angry.&nbsp; And my Virtual Boys still sit, 
                  watching ever vigilant over the store.</font></td>
