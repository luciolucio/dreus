                  &quot;Yes, I'd like to pre-order 30 PS2's for the launch to make 
                  sure I have them.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Not a problem!&quot; spoke the distributor.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>October 2, 2000<br>
                  </b><br>
                  &quot;We're sorry Gord, but your allocation of PS2's has been cut 
                  from 30 to a minimum of 12, to a maximum of 18.&nbsp; Worst case 
                  scenario, you'll get 12.&nbsp; Just so you know.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>October 23, 2000 </b>(3 days prior to PS2 launch).<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;We're sorry Gord, but your allocation of PS2's has been 
                  slightly reduced from 12 units to zero.&nbsp; Is this going to be a 
                  problem?&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;WHAT?!?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Is your not receiving any units going to be a problem.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;How is getting a grand total of zero units when I've 
                  pre-sold many of them not a problem, especially after you told 
                  me I was getting them?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Anyway, the Gord was pissed.&nbsp; Biggest consumer launch ever, 
                  and independent stores get shafted.&nbsp; He was an angry man.&nbsp; But 
                  a resourceful man.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;psst&quot; went the informant.&nbsp; &quot;Wal-Mart will be putting 36 PS2's 
                  up for sale for their launch.&nbsp; I know this because I work 
                  there…&nbsp; And they're in the back.&nbsp; Long live the Gord!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  And a glorious plan was born!&nbsp; Gord gathered his forces, 
                  pulled out one of the couches and some chairs, loaded up a 
                  truck, grabbed the 200 watt speakers, tossed in a big screen 
                  (bigger than the one from the store), and headed to Wal-Mart 
                  for the &quot;Campout of Tomorrow!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, the Gord was thinking ahead.&nbsp; Not only did he bring all 
                  the cool stuff, but he also brought along his PS2 and nearly 
                  all of the games that were already out.&nbsp; He walled off a 
                  section in front of Wal-Mart with pink rope (couldn't locate a 
                  velvet rope), and set everything up.<br>
                  <br>
                  When it was all done, a sign was hung that said &quot;We're better 
                  than you, and we do it in style.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, so pizza was ordered and mad PS2 action was had.&nbsp; 
                  Except for the guy who decided to camp out with his wife who 
                  hated the Gord.&nbsp; The Gord ruined his life!<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;So tell me, why do you hate me so?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Because you're a jerk.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Surely there must be more.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  And it turns out buddy was one of those people who would phone 
                  up and ask &quot;I was last in your store six weeks ago and I want 
                  to know what new titles, used titles, and rentals you have 
                  in.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Sir, I order no less than 30 titles a week new, and that 
                  doesn't factor in rentals or stuff traded in.&nbsp; Mathematically 
                  that would be in the hundreds of titles.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  And then he would get pissed because I wasn't helping.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Can I play the PS2?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Because you think I'm a jerk.&nbsp; Why change that image?&nbsp; 
                  It's not like my letting you play my PS2 would suddenly have 
                  you coming back to my store, especially after you said you 
                  were never coming back anyway.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  And to further ensure that he got no sleep, the speakers were 
                  turned up damn loud and fun was had by all (except annoying 
                  man) as the yelling and music was in serious overtime.&nbsp; I 
                  don't think he ever got any sleep.<br>
                  <br>
                  Eventually the crowds started showing up and drooled over the 
                  PS2 the Gord had with all it's many games.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many were not 
                  appreciative of being told not to cross the line, and &quot;guess 
                  what we're playing and Wal-Mart is sold out of?&nbsp; Oh that's 
                  right, the PS2!&quot;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  And in conclusion, it was the best Christmas ever.</font></td>
