                          was this one account that belonged to a nice lady 
                          with no problems.&nbsp; Anyway, she had on the account one 
                          son could use it, but not the other.<br>
                          <br>
                          So one day the mysterious &quot;other&quot; son comes in and 
                          wants to rent a stack of games and a machine.&nbsp; Well, 
                          lacking a credit card or cash deposit, he wasn't able 
                          to and whined and whined.&nbsp; And whined some more.&nbsp; 
                          Finally the whining to me stopped, so he phoned his 
                          mom and whined to her.&nbsp; Eventually he gave up and left 
                          empty handed.<br>
                          <br>
                          Week later he returns.&nbsp; This time he just wants a 
                          couple games.&nbsp; <br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;I'm sorry, new accounts are limited to one game.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          And the whining began again.&nbsp; My god, why did Lawrence 
                          never return Gord's taser?&nbsp; It's horrible to see 
                          someone 19 whine.&nbsp; Anyway, back to the phone to phone 
                          mommy.<br>
                          <br>
                          Then mommy decides to talk to me.&nbsp; &quot;I'll sign up my 
                          son on my account so he can use it.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Are you sure?&nbsp; That means you'll be responsible for 
                          any late fees or other costs he may incur.&nbsp; (I tried 
                          to make sure she knew that I knew her son was an 
                          idiot).<br>
                          <br>
                          So buddy then rents the games and never brings them 
                          back.&nbsp; Colour Gord surprised.<br>

                          <br>
