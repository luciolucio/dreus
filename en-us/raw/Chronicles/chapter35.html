                  For another summer had come to be at the game store.&nbsp; 
                  During the summer, many of The Gord's patrons would take vacations 
                  at various destinations.&nbsp; The Gord, too, decided he would join 
                  the ranks of those who left the region during the summer 
                  season.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  In fact, The Gord would take a world tour.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  Though fate would not allow The Gord to physically travel away 
                  from the store for 
                  an extended period at this time, so once again The Gord would look 
                  into the past and remember an act from a former mentor.&nbsp; 
                  The mentor's name was Al Bundy.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  The
                  Gord went to the back of the store on a Monday morning, set 
                  up a sign that read &quot;The Gord is on vacation&quot; and then held up a 
                  second sign that read &quot;Today The Gord is in Alaska&quot;.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  Throughout the day, The Gord played games that featured the cold, 
                  from the original Metal Gear Solid (with the base in Alaska) 
                  to various winter sport games to anything with snow in it.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  On the second day of The Gord's vacation, he found himself in 
                  Japan.&nbsp; The sign was changed to read he was in Japan.&nbsp; 
                  Music played that was entirely from Japan, ranging from songs 
                  of DDR fame to groups like TRF, X, and Speed.&nbsp; The Gord 
                  played games that were only available as an import (such as 
                  Tobal No. 2) and watched anime.&nbsp; Good anime, like 
                  Evangelion.&nbsp; Or simply left on the Asian TV channel while 
                  he played StarCraft on the Asian server.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  On the third day, The Gord found himself in France.&nbsp; The TV 
                  was turned to the French channel, the MP3s were of a French 
                  variety, and The Gord played StarCraft all day on the European 
                  servers joining games with French names.&nbsp; The sign read &quot;Gord 
                  is in France!&nbsp; French Fries for everyone, mon ami's!&quot;</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  On the fourth day, The Gord found himself doing a Japanese and 
                  Korean tour again.&nbsp; He 
                  liked it so much the first time, he came back for another day 
                  of Japanese music and Korean StarCraft..&nbsp; </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  Lastly, on the fifth day The Gord found himself on Babylon 5.&nbsp; 
                  It must be true, the sign said so.&nbsp; Babylon 5 was aired.&nbsp; 
                  Babylon 5 movies were rented.&nbsp; Babylon 5 music was 
                  played.&nbsp; The Gord even bought a Babylon 5 poster from the 
                  Babylon 5 gift shop known as eBay.&nbsp; Oddly enough, The Gord 
                  played StarCraft on various space platform levels.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
                  Such was The Gord's five day vacation.</p>
