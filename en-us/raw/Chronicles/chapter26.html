                  <p>&quot;That's illegal to require.&quot;</p>

                  one)</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;You are correct.&nbsp; However, store policy is that 
                  you need government picture ID and a credit card.&nbsp; As a 
                  convenience, we will allow you to substitute a SIN card for a 
                  credit card.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Requiring a SIN card is illegal.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Yes, I agree.&nbsp; However, requiring a credit card is 
                  not.&nbsp; And that is store policy.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I don't have a credit card.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;If you do not have a credit card, we will accept a SIN

                  <p>&quot;That's illegal!&quot;</p>

                  <p>&quot;We're leaving!&quot;</p>
                  <p>Customers leave in a hurry.&nbsp; Gord notices drivers 
                  license was left on the counter.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Chris!&nbsp; Run 
                  this out to them before they drive away.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>But alas, in order to prove that they were manly men, they 
                  just squealed the tires on the road to prove how tough they 
                  were, and paid no attention to Chris trying to get their 
                  attention.</p>
                  <p>So Gord just tosses the drivers license in an envelope and 
                  mails it to the address listed on the license.</p>
                  <p>Three days later....</p>

                  <p><i>&quot;Gamer's Edge.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Yes, my husband was in your store on Sunday, and he left 
                  his license there.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;I mailed that back to you on Monday morning.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Why'd you do that!&nbsp; Why didn't you just call!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Because first, I didn't have the number, and second, 
                  this way takes longer.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You better pay us!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Pay you?&nbsp; For what may I be so bold as to ask?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;My husband hasn't been able to drive to work all week.&nbsp; 
                  You owe us for his lost wages!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;I'm afraid I don't agree to that plan.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;We'll sue!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Would you mind?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;We're never renting from you!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Was that decided before or after I told you I wasn't 
                  renting anything to you?&quot;</i></p>

                  <p>&lt;next day&gt;</p>
                  <p>Seems the price of a letter went up a penny and no one told 
                  Gord, as he never mails anything and the letter was returned 
                  due to insufficient postage.&nbsp; So Gord just dropped 
                  off the license at the government agents office (where you get 
                  your drivers license from) when he paid his electrical bill 
                  across the road that day.</p>

                  <p>&quot;Yes, my husband left his license there on Sunday and you 
                  said you mailed it to us!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Yes, but I was short on the postage.&nbsp; So it came 
                  back.&nbsp; I dropped it off at the court house on Thursday 
                  that way you could pick it up when you were grabbing your 
                  forms to sue me.&nbsp; Did my concierge not phone you?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;We owe for speeding tickets!&nbsp; Now we can't get his 
                  license back!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;And this affects me how?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You have to pay us until he starts working again!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Hey, I do impressions.&nbsp; Here's my impression of me
