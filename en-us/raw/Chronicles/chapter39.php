                    <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Prior to the 
                    days of the game store founding, The Gord had a friend whose 
                    taste in beverages was curious. For this friend enjoyed 
                    Cherry Coke and Mr. Pibb. While this in and of itself was 
                    not out of the ordinary, one must consider that Cherry Coke 
                    nor Mr. Pibb were sold in Canada at the time, and as such 
                    required traveling a great distance to acquire the said 
                    products.<br>
                    <br>
                    In wanting to address his urge to have these drinks, the 
                    friend enlisted The Gord on occasion to drive the two of 
                    them down across the border into the U.S. with The Gord's 
                    truck and purchase a few cans of the drink.<br>
                    <br>
                    By a few cans, we are referring to four hundred on average. 
                    More than thirty boxes of Cherry Coke purchased from a 
                    grocery store a few kilometers south of the border.<br>
                    <br>
                    While that proved to be entertaining to the staff at the 
                    establishment, more fun was had upon returning to Canada. 
                    Customs found great humour in having two young men returning 
                    with nothing more than truckload of Cherry Coke. The 
                    declaration forms were filled, the GST was paid, and 
                    everyone was happy.<br>
                    <br>
                    This exercise would repeat more than once. For the friend 
                    sought to enlighten all he knew with Cherry Coke and 
                    distributed the drink to all who knew him.<br>
                    <br>
                    On the fateful day The Gord open the game store, he 
                    purchased a large stand-up cooler. Into this cooler would be 
                    stocked Cherry Coke and many other drinks only available in 
                    the U.S. For this would be a novelty of the store!<br>
                    <br>
                    Across the border The Gord went with a loyal aid to purchase 
                    the product. But instead of 30 cases, The Gord would 
                    purchase at least 150 cases at a time. Have you ever seen a 
                    red Mazda 4x4 pickup of death burdened with a load of 150 
                    cases of soda? 1800 cans at a minimum, and this was well 
                    beyond the transport design limit. The Japanese had not 
                    meant the vehicle to be used for such madness!<br>
                    <br>
                    During the next several months, Customs did not pay much 
                    attention to The Gord's visits across the border every 3 
                    weeks on average, despite the size of the product. The GST 
                    was paid, and all was happy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Until one dark day…The day of... the new agent…<br>
                    <br>
                    Upon pulling up the customs building with the vehicle over 
                    laden with drinks, the female customs agent asked if The 
                    Gord had anything to declare.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I have nothing to declare&quot; spoke The Gord, knowing full 
                    well that the mass of boxes that exceeded the recommended 
                    load limit of the vehicle in the back of the truck was in 
                    plain sight. An attempt at humour with the new agent.<br>
                    <br>
                    The new agent failed to see the humour and spoke again.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Are you sure you have nothing to declare?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;Well, I did purchase a cheeseburger which I have 
                    consumed.&quot;</i><br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Perhaps some Cherry Coke?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    &lt;Dramatic pause&gt;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;Your silence in exchange for a can?&quot;</i></font></font><p>
                    <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&lt;Dramatic pause&gt;</font></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&quot;Pull ahead 
                    and park please.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Now so far, besides suggesting a poor sense of humour, 
                    nothing was out of the ordinary. Pulling and parking was 
                    nothing new. For this is when The Gord would walk inside to 
                    pay the GST on the product being brought across. Under 
                    Canadian tax laws, all GST paid out by a business are 
                    refunded to the business, so The Gord gets it all back 
                    anyway.<br>
                    <br>
                    But unexpectedly, a different agent walked through the door 
                    to meet The Gord after he had parked. After a brief hello, 
                    the agent spoke of ill news.</font></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp;&quot;I'm 
                    afraid that a complete strip and search of your vehicle has 
                    been ordered.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;That's unfortunate.&quot;</i><br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;So, smuggling anything or transporting anything illegal?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;Nope.&quot;</i><br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;That's good. Search over. So, my game in yet? That new 
                    Final Fantasy one?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;The restock was shipped out on Monday, they should 
                    arrive today or tomorrow. Still coming in on Saturday to 
                    pick it up?&quot;</i><br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Yep.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Fate struck down an intervention into the new evil agents 
                    plan to spite The Gord for a couple hours with an exhaustive 
                    search. The Gord went inside, paid the GST, and went about 
                    his day.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unsuppressed, the new agent would have her revenge. She 
                    concluded that the drinks in the back of truck were for 
                    commercial use. Not an overly long reach, given that The 
                    Gord gave the address of his business on the GST forms and 
                    cited they were for business use in the declaration form. 
                    The call was made… to Canadian Food and Agriculture Agency.<br>
                    <br>
                    Part 2 – Once again, the heat would come down on the 
                    operation.<br>
                    <br>
                    &lt;One week later&gt;<br>
                    <br>
                    Two agents of &quot;the man&quot; approach The Gord in his store. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Are you Gord?&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    If only The Gord had worn black that day…he could have 
                    simply stood up against the black walls and blended into the 
                    black paint as though camouflaged. Sadly, wearing bright 
                    blue shirt with a Japanese kamikaze headband served only to 
                    draw more attention to himself.<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;Depends, do I owe you money? That, or I swear I met her 
                    in a bar. She said she was nineteen.&quot;</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Short version of events from this point: Canada has rules 
                    about food labelling; specifically all packaged items must 
                    list all ingredients in English and in French. The Gord was 
                    served notice he must repackage the cans with ingredient 
                    lists in both official languages. Further, a few of the 
                    drinks were not sanctioned for sale in Canada due to the 
                    compounds used in the production of some drinks. Caffeine in 
                    the American Mountain Dew, a dye used in of the other 
                    drinks, and a preservative not sanctioned for use in non-dry 
                    foods. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Gord decided it was not worth continuing on the 
                    exhaustive journey to the continental United States for a 
                    reduced number of products to sell. Actually, that’s a big 
                    lie. It was the thought of having to re-label every can to 
                    be sold while Canadian soda was already cheaper to sell 
                    anyway.<br>
                    <br>
                    Whatever became of the stock that remained? It was sold off 
                    during an afternoon of “take my black market soda! I can’t 
                    take cash, but I’ll take anything else! All offers 
                    considered!” The most curious trade-in towards the 
                    substantial pile of the now black-market soda was a 
                    PlayStation lighted display panel from Wal-Mart. The Gord 
                    was going to ask how the individual had acquired such a 
                    novelty, but thought it wiser to not know.<br>
                    <br>
                    A couple months later the first and last “Cherry Coke 
                    Tournament of hope” was held. The winner, the last saved 
                    carton of Cherry Coke and a new game. </font><br>
