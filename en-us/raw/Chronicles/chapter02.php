                          Wrestlemania 2000 for the N64.&nbsp; Anyway, it never comes 
                          back.&nbsp; The people on the phone claim he moved, and the 
                          mail was returned.&nbsp; So off to collections it goes.<br>

                          &quot;I tried to get a loan from my bank to buy a car, and

                          &quot;Now no one will lend me any money because they think

                          </i><br>
                          &quot;You have to remove it from my record.&quot;<br>

                          <i>&quot;Let's see, you want me to commit fraud so you look

                          for me to partake in your plan.&nbsp; How about you pay off 
                          the debt and then it will show it as being paid in 
                          full.&quot;<br>

                          Buddy then starts to almost cry as he leaves.&nbsp; Then 
                          the next day the nice folks from the money place 
                          across the road pay me a visit.&nbsp; Apparently he was 
                          trying to get money from everyone for his car loan.&nbsp; 
                          No one would touch him as long as he owed me.&nbsp; Alas, 
                          poor thief, for Gord has ruined him.<br>
                          <br>
                          Next day, his girlfriend shows up.&nbsp; Now this is good, 
                          she tries to go into how she works at a bank and she 
                          knows &quot;the law!&quot;&nbsp; <br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;You can't list stuff like that on the bureau.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Yes, yes I can.&nbsp; It's a debt, or a credit if you 
                          will.&nbsp; This credit was never paid.&nbsp; This would be an 
                          example of poor credit history.&quot;<br>
                          </i><br>
                          &quot;That's illegal!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;And you're the one that works at the bank?&nbsp; Whoa, 
                          standards sure seem to have fallen.&nbsp; And what's 
                          illegal is buddy stealing the game.&nbsp; Why not just tell 
                          him to get off his ass and pay me, then he might get 
                          his loan.&nbsp; No one is going to give him any money as 
                          long as he has outstanding bad debts.&quot;<br>
                          </i><br>
                          This went on back and forth about how she knows the 
                          law and she works at a bank and how her mom always 
                          said she was a special child.&nbsp; I later learned she was 
                          the part-time receptionist when I stopped in at the 
                          bank (as I had an old account there).<br>
