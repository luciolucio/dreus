                  One of the most annoying parts of the gaming industry is how 
                  everyone thinks they are an expert and that, just because 
                  everyone assumes something is true, it must be true.&nbsp; So 
                  now The Gord will strike down with the horrible truth upon the 
                  realm of lies!&nbsp;
                  <p>The first proclamation on setting straight these false 
                  truths, the mythological idea that consoles have always been 
                  sold below cost.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to popular mythology, the idea of selling a 
                  console at below cost <br>
                  is a rather new phenomenon.&nbsp; It it not an ancient practice 
                  handed down <br>
                  through the ages.<br>
                  <br>
                  To understand how this came to be thought, you have to step 
                  back to 1994.<br>
                  <br>
                  Late in 1994, there were two videogame systems introduced unto 
                  the world.&nbsp; The Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation...and 
                  these consoles were not cheap.&nbsp; With the exchange rate at the 
                  time, both consoles were well over $500 US each.<br>
                  <br>
                  When Sony had demoed the system a year before, the video game 
                  world stopped and drooled.&nbsp; It was unlike anything they'd ever seen 
                  before.&nbsp; Fully 3D texture mapped goodness at over 300,000 
                  polygons a second.&nbsp; The 3DO by comparison which was released a 
                  couple months prior clocked in at around 20,000.<br>
                  <br>
                  Popular legend also has it that, when Sony unveiled the PlayStation, 
                  the president of Sega walked down to the R&amp;D department of 
                  Sega where they were working on the forthcoming Saturn.&nbsp; The 
                  Saturn was to be the ultimate 2D system.&nbsp; He spoke not so 
                  softly.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Why am I looking at that PlayStation and going 'god damn, 
                  that is so going <br>
                  to kick our asses?'&quot;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Fear not, our leader, for we have designed the ultimate 2D 
                  system to crush <br>
                  the scourge that is the 16-bit Nintendo and lay claim to all 
                  that we see!&quot;</p>
                  <p><b>&lt;BLAM!&gt;</b></p>
                  <p>&quot;I'll repeat the question!&nbsp; Why do I see 3D prettiness over 
                  in Camp Sony and none in Camp Sega?&quot;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Well, our arcade division has those $20,000 arcade 
                  cabinets which are <br>
                  better than the PlayStation!&quot;</p>
                  <p><b>&lt;BLAM!&gt;</b></p>
                  <p>&quot;Why do I not hear what I want to hear?&nbsp; When next I 
                  return, I want 3D <br>
                  prettiness!&quot;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Yes sir!&quot;</p>
                  <p>&quot;And Mr. Kim...&quot;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                  <p><b>&lt;BLAM!&gt;</b></p>
                  <p>&quot;I never liked you.&nbsp; That's for bringing your GameBoy to 
                  work.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, the Saturn was basically the ultimate 2D machine that 
                  had 3D slapped on at the end of the development cycle, and it 
                  showed.&nbsp; Poor development software, unstylish motherboard 
                  design, and all around 3D ugliness for it's launch games.<br>
                  <br>
                  So there we were.&nbsp; End of 1994, the PlayStation and Saturn 
                  were upon Japan at more than $500 each.<br>
                  <br>
                  Curious note:&nbsp; In Japan (with exchange rates at the time), 
                  minimum wage was $3000 US a month.&nbsp; So while $500 seems like a 
                  lot, that's less than a weeks wage.<br>
                  <br>
                  Flash forward to May 1995.&nbsp; The E3 Expo was having it's first 
                  go, and <br>
                  everyone showed up.&nbsp; Nintendo was telling us to wait for the 
                  Ultra 64 as it <br>
                  could do &quot;real-time ray tracing&quot; and was just so damn pretty 
                  they couldn't <br>
                  show it to us as we weren't ready to handle it.&nbsp; For if we saw 
                  it, we would <br>
                  go insane!<br>
                  <br>
                  At the show, Sega and Sony announced their launch plans.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sega: &quot;The Saturn will be $399US.... and it's out now!&nbsp; We 
                  launched it <br>
                  today!&nbsp; Remember Pearl Harbor?&nbsp; That's right!&nbsp; Strike when 
                  don't expect it!&nbsp; Take that Sony!&nbsp; We are going to kill you 
                  and dance about on your grave!&nbsp; You can't handle us!&nbsp; We're 
                  Sega!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Immediately following that press conference down the hall was 
                  the Sony press conference.&nbsp; There was a big lead up to what 
                  the price point would be, and when it would be launched.&nbsp; 
                  Finally, the president of Sony walked out slowly on stage and a 
                  silence fell upon the room.&nbsp; We all awaited his words, and 
                  finally he spoke.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Two hundred ninety-nine dollars.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Then he turned and walked away.<br>
                  <br>
                  Back at the Sega conference room....<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Oh no!&nbsp; This can't be happening!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Everyone was in awe.&nbsp; Sony was bringing the super console 
                  known as the <br>
                  PlayStation to America for almost half the price it was 
                  selling for in Japan.<br>
                  <br>
                  This brought force claims of dumping by Atari.&nbsp; Atari swore 
                  that they would have the PlayStation stopped before it came 
                  out at that price &quot;because it <br>
                  was being sold below cost and that's dumping!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The myth was born.<br>
                  <br>
                  By the time the PlayStation came out in North America 4 months 
                  later, a lot <br>
                  had changed during the year.&nbsp; RAM had gone from $50US a 
                  megabyte to $20.&nbsp; The Yen had gone from 80 yen per US dollar 
                  to 110.&nbsp; And Sega had dropped the price of the Saturn to 
                  $299.&nbsp; At this point the PlayStation was indeed profitable, 
                  and the Saturn was a minor money pit for Sega.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sega was not only losing money on the Saturn, but asked 
                  retailers to expect
                  the same.&nbsp; A &quot;modest $15 per console&quot; loss to help Sega.&nbsp; 
                  Well, you can <br>
                  imagine what many retailers said...<br>
                  <br>
                  The Saturn was the first console that was actively being 
                  marketed and the <br>
                  company was losing money.&nbsp; While Sony was building the 
                  PlayStation from parts they made themselves, Sega was paying a 
                  higher price and buying parts from others.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Nintendo 64 came out the next year at $199 US.&nbsp; Nintendo 
                  claims that <br>
                  they were not losing money on units sold, which I have no 
                  doubt not to <br>
                  believe.&nbsp; Nintendo has better things to do than sell a console 
                  at a loss.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Dreamcast was a money losing venture for Sega.&nbsp; Sega went 
                  for broke in building the best&nbsp;console they could buy with 
                  the Dreamcast, and sold them at less than cost.&nbsp; A lot less 
                  than cost.&nbsp; The theory being that scale of economics 
                  would catch up to let them rebuild their once glorious market 
                  share and, that the margins on their own games would be good 
                  enough to justify a loss.<br>
                  <br>
                  $800 million lost later, Sega cancelled the Dreamcast.<br>
                  <br>
                  Xbox.&nbsp; MS has decided to follow the Sega model.&nbsp; Buy off the 
                  shelf parts, <br>
                  have someone else build it, and take a loss in order to push 
                  units out the <br>
                  door.&nbsp; The Xbox was to have been a super console that could do 
                  200 million polygons a second... and then 300 million!&nbsp; Then 
                  125&nbsp; million.... then... well, tech demo's have it running at 
                  60 million.<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, Microsoft is losing money per console sold, not 
                  including what they are spending advertising and support.&nbsp; 
                  Reports have it fall between $50 to $105 lost per console.&nbsp; MS 
                  has only said that they are losing money, and <br>
                  won't comment on how much.<br>
                  <br>
                  Notice what isn't on that list?&nbsp; The PS2.<br>
                  <br>
                  Unlike Sega and MS, Sony is an R&amp;D hardware company.&nbsp; They 
                  make a lot of things.&nbsp; In designing up the PS2, they spent a 
                  lot of cash.&nbsp; Then they spent a hell of a lot more cash to 
                  build things like the chip foundries to <br>
                  produce the chips for the PS2.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the end, before the first PS2 rolled off the production line 
                  for <br>
                  consumers, Sony had spent $2 billion!&nbsp; TWO BILLION!<br>
                  <br>
                  Then we look at Sony's stock report for Oct-Dec 2000, and 
                  there is an <br>
                  interesting little blurb.&nbsp; It said that had Sony been able to 
                  meet demand <br>
                  with another 1 million PS2 units, they would have pocketed 
                  $175 million in <br>
                  profits.&nbsp; $175 million divided by one million consoles equals 
                  $175 per <br>
                  console profit.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, that is a bit high.&nbsp; This assumed that the average consumer 
                  continues to buy four games per console (so around $24 in 
                  royalties), and 2 accessories (about $30 in profit total).&nbsp; 
                  That reduces the $175 to about $120.&nbsp; Sony is making $120 
                  profit per system.<br>
                  <br>
                  Granted, they have to sell nearly 20 million PS2s to pay back 
                  the $2 billion <br>
                  they already spent, but that shouldn't be a problem since they 
                  already <br>
                  passed that.<br>
                  <br>
                  At this point, it's free money.<br>
                  <br>
                  Also not on the list is the GameCube.&nbsp; I haven't got numbers 
                  from anyone <br>
                  yet, but it would seem that at $199 it's a break-even for 
                  Nintendo.&nbsp; And <br>
                  since Nintendo is planning on being the top software producer 
                  on their <br>
                  system, they could quite easily eat a huge loss per system if 
                  they really <br>
                  wanted to.<p><i>Edit - 12/17/01 - Nick Maragos over at &quot;Gaming 
                  Intelligence Agency&quot;&nbsp; sent me this link
                  <a href="http://www.thegia.com/news/0108/n23r.php">
                  http://www.thegia.com/news/0108/n23r.php</a> that has this in 
                  it:</i><p><i><b>In more general matters, Mr. Main admitted 
                  that the GameCube's pricing would not initially follow 
                  Nintendo's rule of turning a profit on every console sold. &quot;We 
                  expect to incur a small loss on the GameCube hardware 
                  initially, and you're right that it hasn't been our habit in 
                  the past but we expect it to turn okay early next year.&quot;</b></i><p>
                  <i>So it appears that now Nintendo has joined the ranks of 
                  console manufacturers that outsource their machine production 
                  and takes losses.</i><br>
                  <br>
                  So there we have it.&nbsp; The myth that was &quot;all consoles are sold 
                  below cost&quot; <br>
                  has been vanquished!&nbsp; Go forth and spread the word of The Gord, 
                  and may the
                  light of truth chase away the shadows of lies!<p>
                  &nbsp;<p>
                  <b>Follow-up: February 2003</b><p>
                  It amuses me the amount of email I received from people 
                  claiming that I was wrong about the PS2 and profitability.&nbsp; 
                  That somehow I misjudged numbers or was making things up.&nbsp; 
                  After all, mythology never lies.<p>
                  Apparently this article was just a little too much reading for 
                  some people who would rather conclude nothing was said than 
                  actually bother to learn how this industry works.&nbsp; Fine, 
                  here's the short version: <p>
                  <i>It's not I 
                  saying that Sony has always made a unit profit on each PS2 sold, 
                  but Sony themselves claiming that.&nbsp; In both the press 
                  conferences for follow-up questions pertaining to the 2000 and 
                  2001 stock report for investors, which were available online in audio files 
                  on Sony's website for months after the publication of their 
                  annual report, Sony openly discussed how the PS2 is profitable 
                  on each unit sold. </i> <p>
                  End of short version.&nbsp; Everything else beyond that is the 
                  how and why everything works the way it does.&nbsp;
                  Is Sony going to go out and make a press release about it? 
                  &quot;Hey!&nbsp; We're making $100 profit per console sold while MS 
                  loses $100 on each Xbox!&quot;&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; People 
                  want their hardware as cheap as possible with the perception 
                  that it cost a lot.&nbsp; Consumers want a deal.&nbsp;They 
                  want their perceived value.&nbsp; It 
                  helps to justify why games are $50 brand new instead of the 
                  $19 they should be.&nbsp; Others want to believe that 
                  companies like Sony made the PS2 because they love video games 
                  and profit from a console sale goes against everything they 
                  believe in.&nbsp; A number of people are offended at the idea 
                  a console manufacturer would make a profit as they've lived 
                  the lie of every console is sold below cost for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                  Plus others will say &quot;there must be a price drop coming!&quot; and 
                  push off purchasing a console.&nbsp; <p>
                  Plus for us to accept that Sony is lying and that they are in 
                  fact losing money per console sold, that means we have to 
                  accept that hundreds of employees are all conspiring to cover 
                  the truth and risking their personal fortunes and possible 
                  jail time to cover a secret that would be discovered 
                  eventually.&nbsp; <p>
                  Let's keep our eyes on the ball people.&nbsp; Sony has sold 
                  more than fifty million PS2s. Lets pretend Sony has been lying 
                  to us all along and that the PS2 is a money pit. Assuming a 
                  true cost/price different of $200 (from the originally claimed&nbsp; 
                  cost of $100 below retail to $100 above retail) on fifty 
                  million units, that's ten billion dollars.&nbsp; TEN BILLION.&nbsp; 
                  People are going to notice ten billion dollars missing from 
                  the bank accounts.&nbsp; Hell, let's say Sony isn't even 
                  losing any money at all but instead are selling at cost.&nbsp; 
                  Ok, so it's only five billion dollars missing from the bank 
                  account.&nbsp; Don't dare to try and claim that this number 
                  could possibly hidden as as a rounding error.<p>
                  It's not like it's some great secret that Sony makes money 
                  hand over fist on the PS2.&nbsp; While Nintendo, Sega, and 
                  Microsoft all outsource production, Sony makes everything 
                  themselves.&nbsp; Outsourcing means that someone else is in 
                  the loop who has to make a profit.&nbsp; No one works for 
                  free.<p>
                  Don't blame the messenger if you are angry that I opened your 
                  eyes to the economic realities of this market.</td>
