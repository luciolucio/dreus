                  for the same price!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Well, on my world, things are priced differently based on 
                  my cost and demand for the item.&nbsp; But mostly my cost.&nbsp; If I 
                  sold you Crazy Taxi for $30, I'd lose $20.&nbsp; Now, where I come 
                  from that's B. A. D.&nbsp; Bad.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Don't lie to me!&nbsp; I know you're making money at $30!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You're right.&nbsp; On games that are priced at $30, I probably 
                  am making money as my cost would be less than $30.&quot;</i></font></p>
