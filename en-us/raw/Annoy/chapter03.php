                    <font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">So a kid, around 19, 
                    signs up a new account.&nbsp; He decides to rent Sled Storm, and 
                    then never comes back.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, ok.&nbsp; Gord left a couple 
                    messages to return the game, but no luck.&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually the young adult phones and says he returned it.&nbsp; 
                    Uh-huh… That's right.<br>
                    <br>
                    So Gord forwards the account to collections.<br>
                    <br>
                    One day a few months later this lady walks in and starts 
                    yelling about how Gord sent her son to collections and 
                    ruined his credit rating so now he can't buy a car or stereo 
                    or something.&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    Gord points out the obvious point that he stole a game and 
                    is a poor credit risk.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then the mother throws the game on the counter and says that 
                    the game is now back and I have to fix his credit.<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;Ma'am, first off, the game is destroyed.&nbsp; Look at it.&nbsp; 
                    Second, I've replaced the game already so I don't want it 
                    back. Instead, I seek the money for my cost on replacing it 
                    and the late fees he owed.&nbsp; Third, your son claimed he 
                    returned it.&nbsp; &quot;<br>
                    </i><br>
                    This just sets her off.&nbsp; Something about how it's not her 
                    son's fault that he stole the game.<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;How is it not his fault?&quot;<br>
                    </i><br>
                    &quot;Because I brought it back.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;That excuses the original theft and lying to me?&quot;<br>
                    </i><br>
                    &quot;It's not his fault he lied and tried to steal it!&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>&quot;Might I ask whose fault it is then?&quot;<br>
                    </i><br>
                    Anyway, she starts yelling some more about how her son is 
                    never going to rent from Gord ever again.&nbsp; Gord points out 
                    that was exactly his point and that he had already closed 
                    the account when it was sent to collections.&nbsp; So she stormed 
                    out.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Gord often wonders why people threaten to never come 
                    back after they've been told never to return.</font></td>
