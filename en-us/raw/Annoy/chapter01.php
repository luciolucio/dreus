                  <p>Originally this lad was dismissed as an idiot as he was going 
                    on about how he took six broken PS1's and made three working 
                    ones with them... Then went on to try and rent a machine.

                  <p><i>&quot;If you've got 3 working ones, why do you want to rent 
                    one?&quot;</i> questioned Gord.</p>
                  <p>&quot;Uhm... ya... So I want to program, and I've got four 
                    programs I'm working on right now, so I need a fourth machine. 
                    Because you see, to program a PS1, you need to leave it hooked 
                    up to the computer the whole time you're writing the one game.&quot;

                    Gord.</p>
                  <p>Then he brings his dad in to sign up an account, and then 
                    it's &quot;Why do I need ID or a deposit to rent a machine?&quot; 
                    and &quot;$5 to rent a machine? You can buy them for $140!&quot;</p>

                    the counter, so they walk over to see it. </p>

                  <p>&quot;You see, being that I've taken apart and fixed a couple 
                    PlayStations, I can tell you what's wrong with this unit. 
                    First up, the power switch is missing... and blah blah blah
