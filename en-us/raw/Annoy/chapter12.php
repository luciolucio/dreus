                    with the idea put forth to him that he should liquidate all 
                    his crap PlayStation games that haven't sold in a while by 
                    putting them in a grab bin, as &quot;grab bins are cool.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    So Gord instead created a &quot;Magic Box&quot; full of $10 games.&nbsp; 
                    Just like a grab bin, only magical! (You can watch the games 
                    disappear! -ed)<br>

                    Customer sees magic box, looks through it, walks away to 
                    used game section that is across the store.&nbsp; Customer grabs 
                    Xenogears (priced at $50), walks back to magic box, looks in 
                    it again, and then walks up to front counter.<br>
