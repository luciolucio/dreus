                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This young thief wasn't that bright.<br>
                  <br>
                  Who would steal old Genesis sports games?&nbsp; Well, no one 
                  usually.&nbsp; So Gord would just leave them in the boxes on the 
                  floor.&nbsp; Why steal a game priced at $5?<br>
                  <br>
                  Well, seems three young thieves decided they really wanted 
                  Rugby and couldn't raise the $5 for the price tag.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Gord 
                  wasn't paying attention to the kids as they were only looking 
                  at Genesis games, but his brother noticed that they pocketed 
                  one game.<br>
                  <br>
                  When they left the Gord was informed of their act, and the 
                  Gord confirmed the game was stolen.&nbsp; So he stepped out to 
                  catch up to them.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Hey!&nbsp; You!&quot; </i>proclaimed the Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  The kids keep walking.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Stop already!&quot;</i> suggested the Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  (perhaps they were thinking if they ignored the Gord, the Gord 
                  would go away).<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;DON'T MAKE ME RUN!!&quot;</i> yelled the Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  The kids stopped.&nbsp; The Gord approached.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Alright, give me the game back.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Two of the kids looked guilty and kept their eyes at the 
                  ground.&nbsp; The third kid went into mouthy mode.&nbsp; Three guesses 
                  who had the game, first two don't count.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You can't touch us!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Wrong.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;What?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I<i>'m going to do to you the same thing that happened to the 
                  last thief I caught.&nbsp; I'm going to toss you into a wall, into 
                  a van, and into a wall again. &quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You can't do that!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Good news for you, there is no van here.&nbsp; Bad news, you're 
                  going into that wall twice.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  And the Gord grabbed the kid and picked him up.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Ok!&nbsp; Ok!&nbsp; I'll give you your game back!&quot; as he began to 
                  scream and tears came out of his eyes.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Gord was a forgiving Gord.&nbsp; He spared the child and 
                  returned with his game.&nbsp; And the young child entered his 
                  excommunication from the store.&nbsp; </font></td>
