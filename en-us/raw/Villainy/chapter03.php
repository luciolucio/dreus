                  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Everyone was 
                  gathered in the back of the store watching an entranced gamer 
                  complete Final Fantasy VIII.&nbsp; During this time, a lone 
                  individual entered the store and went straight for the N64 
                  game thief bait.<br>
                  <br>
                  Upon noticing this, Gord then returned to the front counter.&nbsp; 
                  He observed that the bait was taken.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Anything in particular you're looking for?&quot; </i>queried 
                  Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Uhm…&nbsp; Do you have any more copies of Einhander?&quot; was the 
                  response, as the individual apparently paid no attention to 
                  the stack of Einhanders directly in front of him.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Yes, I have lots.&quot;&nbsp;</i> Then after a dramatic pause Gord 
                  asked<i> &quot;So, are you familiar with the phrase 'the jig is 
                  up?'&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Suddenly a van screams to a halt in front of the store and the 
                  driver hits the horn.&nbsp; Buddy then books it outside and 
                  runs towards the van full bore.&nbsp; The van door slides open 
                  and the mysterious individual does a tuck and roll into the 
                  side of the van.&nbsp; The van then screams off down the 
                  street.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Well, that was odd&quot;</i> noted Gord.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Why would 
                  someone go to all that trouble of setting such an elaborate 
                  scheme up only to use a van with a company logo on the side?&quot;&nbsp; </i><br>
                  <br>
                  While normally Gord would phone up the person directly and ask 
                  why they stole a game, since buddy had gone for a collective 
                  stack of crap N64 games he phoned the police.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Half hour later&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  The police return with buddy in hand.&nbsp; Seems he really 
                  wants to apologize and pay for the games.&nbsp; Something 
                  about being on probation and he'll lose his job, go to jail, 
                  and how he was offering to pay for the games to avoid those 
                  problems.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Hmm&quot;</i> thought Gord.&nbsp; For he was the Caesar and the 
                  life of the young thief was his to control.&nbsp; Would Gord 
                  be a benevolent Gord or a contentious Gord?&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Today Gord was a benevolent Gord.&nbsp; For the prices on the 
                  crap N64 games were exponentially priced far beyond their 
                  values to increase the attractiveness of the titles to 
                  prospective thieves.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Very well, here you go&quot; and the Gord was paid in full.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I trust I will not see you in here again for a number of 
                  years?&quot; </i>asked Gord as he brought up the issue of the 
                  excommunication of the would be thief.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Actually, I'll be back on Friday.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;What?&quot;</i>&nbsp; decried Gord, setback by this unforeseen 
                  statement.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I like this store, I'll be back on payday to buy more games.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;err….. Ok.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  And thus the thief was reformed and made into a traditional 
                  customer.&nbsp; The work of Gord transforms all!</font></td>
