                  <font face="Times New Roman">The nice thing about credit cards 
                  is that if someone steals your card or gets your number, you 
                  aren't responsible for any purchases they make on it.<br>
                  <br>
                  So one brilliant thief thought &quot;hey!&nbsp; I'll just use my credit 
                  card to buy a bunch of crap and claim it was stolen!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Well, that would have been the plan had he thought it through 
                  first.&nbsp; Instead, his plan was more like &quot;damn, I spent too 
                  much money.&nbsp; I'll just claim the credit card was stolen.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  So about 5 months after the purchases were made the Gord got a 
                  letter and phone call from Visa saying buddy was contesting the 
                  charges and that his card was stolen.&nbsp; In their conversations 
                  it comes up that buddy is contesting some $4K worth of 
                  purchases all over the place.<br>
                  <br>
                  When the Gord pulled up the name of the person who was 
                  contesting the charges, he found a rather curious item.<br>
                  <br>
                  The same day he bought his N64 and games, he also signed up an 
                  account so he could rent games.&nbsp; Seems buddy had completely 
                  forgot that he had provided the Gord with his drivers license 
                  and SIN card as ID.&nbsp; Any hope that Visa was going to believe 
                  that his card was stolen went out the window.<br>
                  <br>
                  And the Gord notes that a plan is best planned first and not 
                  after.</font></td>
