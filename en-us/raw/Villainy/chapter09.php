                  <font face="Times New Roman">So one day Gord decides he wants 
                  to restock his fridge, but he doesn't want to head to the bulk 
                  store to buy 20 flats of pop.&nbsp; So Gord sends a few of the 
                  regulars from the store in a convoy to buy some cases 
                  from the local grocery store.&nbsp; 5 kids, 15 cases, so not a 
                  problem.<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, on the way back the convoy was attacked just like out 
                  of the old west!&nbsp; Bandits ambushed the convoy, brandishing 
                  shotguns and wearing bandannas and cowboy hats! At high noon!&nbsp; 
                  In the desert!<br>
                  <br>
                  Or rather, a 15 year old girl came up and stole a case off the 
                  stack one of the kids was carrying.<br>
                  <br>
                  So, the Gord was perplexed.&nbsp; He wasn't about to go about 
                  beating a girl, but no one escapes the wrath of Gord!<br>
                  <br>
                  So Gord walked down the street and caught up to her.&nbsp; At first 
                  she claimed she was given the case, then she threw the case at 
                  Gord and began screaming there was nothing he could do to her.<br>
                  <br>
                  Oh the Gord can always do something….&nbsp; Never taunt the Gord!<br>
                  <br>
                  So Gord phoned up the parents and let them know that their 
                  daughter was involved in a shoplifting incident.&nbsp; The parents 
                  were very not impressed with their innocent daughter.<br>
                  <br>
                  So the father comes down and brings the thief with him.&nbsp; He 
                  forces her to pay for what she stole at retail, and makes her 
                  apologize.<br>
                  <br>
                  So all was done except for the excommunication.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I trust I won't see you in here again till you're 19?&quot; </i>
                  spoke the Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Why the fuck would I ever want to come back here?&quot; was the 
                  retort.<br>
                  <br>
                  </font><i><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Because I'm a sexy 
                  man.&quot;</font></i></td>
