                  <font face="Times New Roman">So there was Gord sitting in his 
                  chair and socializing with some of the regulars who come to 
                  his store when in comes the young would-be thieves.<br>
                  <br>
                  After walking around the store and coming to the conclusion 
                  that the only live stock is the games behind the counter, they 
                  come up with a brilliant plan.&nbsp; They'll just reach over while 
                  Gord is standing there and steal a game.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Can I use the phone?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Sure.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Buddy then reaches over to use the phone on the wall, only he 
                  keeps on going over and says &quot;hey… Fifa…&quot; and picks up the 
                  game, puts it in his jacket, and then goes to pick up the 
                  phone.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Well this kid is the idiot of the week I must say.&quot; </i>
                  thought Gord.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Does he not understand you're suppose to 
                  steal the game when I'm not looking, and you don't announce it 
                  to the world that you're stealing it?&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  And in his absolute brilliance, he phones his house.&nbsp; Oh joy.&nbsp; 
                  Now Gord not only knew who he was (as the other people in the 
                  store knew him), but now the Gord had his phone # to boot.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sadly there were other customers in the store at the time so 
                  the Gord delegated the authority of picking up the kid as he 
                  left the store to another who was of sufficient stature to 
                  close the issue.&nbsp; A demi-Gord if you will.<br>
                  <br>
                  As demi-Gord approached the young thief, the thief made a 
                  break for it.&nbsp; The chase was on, and the Gord was not part of 
                  it.&nbsp; The Gord was saddened.<br>
                  <br>
                  Eventually the substitute Gord returned with the game in hand, 
                  rather pissed at the distance he had to run and that the kid 
                  ended up grabbing a rather large stick.<br>
                  <br>
                  No one escapes the wrath of Gord!&nbsp; Gord had his name, and 
                  quickly found out where this thief's locker was and what class 
                  he was in next using his vast resources.<br>
                  <br>
                  To the high school went the Gord and the substitute Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  Once in the school the thief was quickly spotted and 
                  approached.&nbsp; He didn't see the Gord approach and was rambling 
                  on about how he stole a game and that he got away free.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I do believe you are the one I am looking for&quot; </i>spoke 
                  the Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; declared the thief.&nbsp; &quot;You can't do anything to me!&nbsp; 
                  I'm in the school!&nbsp; You can't hurt me!&quot; as he backed up 
                  against the lockers.<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;You're right&quot; spoke the Gord.&nbsp; &quot;However, my friend here who 
                  is also in school can.&quot;&nbsp;</i> Gord snapped his fingers and the 
                  demi-Gord approached the thief to begin the beating.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Wait!&quot; cried the thief.&nbsp; &quot;Let's take this outside.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  And outside they all went, for it was considerably easier to 
                  do anything out of sight of the authorities.<br>
                  <br>
                  As the group approached the Gord's Mazda of Death, the Gord 
                  grabbed the thief by the scruff of his jacket and spoke <i>&quot;Get 
                  in the vehicle, we're going for a ride.&quot;</i>&nbsp; (the plan was 
                  to take the thief to the local police station so that he could 
                  confess to his crimes)<br>
                  <br>
                  Alas, the thief began screaming, crying and wet his pants.&nbsp; 
                  Apparently he got the idea in his head that they were going to 
                  take him out of town and gang beat him.&nbsp; Gord knows this as 
                  this information was relayed back to him later.<br>
                  <br>
                  Others ran to the aid of this now crying thief on his knees 
                  screaming.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Let him go!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Or what?&quot;</i> spoke the Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You want some of me?&quot; suggested the thieves friend.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Look at you.&nbsp; You might be intimidating to a small child.&nbsp; 
                  But I'm not a small child.&nbsp; Now shut the hell up and walk 
                  away.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  And the would be savoir of the thief backed away.<br>
                  <br>
                  At this time the principal arrived and took all involved to 
                  his office and settled the issue.&nbsp; Thief suspended from 
                  school, parents called, etc.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  And the best part was when the thief when into hommie speak 
                  about how he could have kicked our asses and it's lucky the 
                  principal showed up to save us.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;How about you shut up or I'll leave this room for a few 
                  minutes, and when I come back I'll hear how you fell out of 
                  your chair and into the desk and floor a few times?&nbsp; Look at 
                  him!&nbsp; He's a gorilla compared to you!&quot; the principal spoke 
                  concerning the demi-Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  And thus ended the &quot;Hey, Fifa!&quot; caper.</font></td>
