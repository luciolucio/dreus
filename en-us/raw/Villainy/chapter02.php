                  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">For the longest 
                  time Gord used to price crap N64 game cartridges with high 
                  prices and leave them on the shelves for people to try and 
                  steal.&nbsp; Madden 64--$50.&nbsp; Wayne Gretzky '98--$45, etc.&nbsp; Usually 
                  it was just one game at a time.<br>
                  <br>
                  So buddy comes in and steals Automobilee Lamborghini.&nbsp; Rather 
                  than run for it, he walks around before finally leaving.&nbsp; So 
                  once he steps outside Gord hops over the counter and step 
                  outside.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Hey! YOU!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  And boom!&nbsp; The one punk bolts.&nbsp; But to make sure Gord has the 
                  right person, Gord grabs the one just standing there.&nbsp; His scream 
                  like that of a little girl&nbsp; pretty much cleared any doubt that 
                  the runner had the crap game.<br>
                  <br>
                  With strides being nearly a foot longer than the runner, Gord 
                  was able to catch up in a block.&nbsp; The thief tosses 
                  the game behind a dumpster and begins screaming &quot;I don't have 
                  the…&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;BOOM!&gt;&nbsp; Football tackle action!<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord gets pissed when someone makes him run.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;ARGH!!!!!!!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord begins to throw the punk around.&nbsp; Into the side of the 
                  garbage bin, into the fence, into the cement wall, into the 
                  side a commercial van, back into the cement wall.&nbsp; And damn 
                  hard.&nbsp; This thief was in pain.<br>
                  <br>
                  One hand goes up on thief's neck, and the other goes for his 
                  glasses to make sure he doesn't try to run.<br>
                  <br>
                  At this point the thief begins screaming like a little girl.&nbsp; 
                  He was pinned against a wall by his 
                  neck and his glasses were just removed, so perhaps he assumed Gord was going smack his head around.<br>
                  <br>
                  Instead Gord tossed him into a choking headlock and dragged him 
                  back to the store.&nbsp; He was saying something about how he 
                  couldn't breathe, but no one understood a word he was saying.&nbsp; 
                  Gord even stopped and asked him to speak up.<br>
                  <br>
                  Back at the store Gord locked the front door, and headed to the 
                  counter.&nbsp; At this point the punk was being bent over backwards in some 
                  painful hold.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I'm going to phone the police now.&nbsp; I'll let you go as 
                  long as you sit down and don't move, alright?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;OK.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Surprising no one, as soon as Gord let him go he made a break 
                  for the door…&nbsp; Shame no one told him the door was locked and 
                  made of glass that was one step down from bulletproof glass.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;BOOM&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  Ass over tea kettle.&nbsp; KO'd in one hit.&nbsp; So Gord phoned the 
                  police and afterwards, he went and picked the thief up and gently slapped him 
                  around to wake him up.&nbsp; (he was groggy at this point, but fear 
                  brought him around pretty quick).<br>
                  <br>
                  At this point he decided to he was going to kick his way to 
                  freedom.&nbsp; So back to the football thing, and Gord ran him into 
                  the wall as he carried the thief in front of him.&nbsp; If you look closely 
                  you can still see the imprint in the wall.<br>
                  <br>
                  That pretty much finished him off.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  After this, a customer came in after this who knew the thief.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Dave… please… help me….&lt;sob&gt;…&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Uhm… I don't know you…&nbsp; Gord, do you have any copies of 
                  Tekken 3 in?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ya, right at the end there.&nbsp; And one copy just came back, 
                  it's sitting on the counter.&nbsp; You can just take that one.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Ok.&nbsp; Take care.&nbsp; I'll leave the money on the counter.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  All while Gord has this punk pinned to the wall.<br>
                  <br>
                  The police showed up after that and he was taken away.&nbsp; During 
                  his take away he was screaming something about how Gord beat 
                  him and such, but no one could remember anything like that.&nbsp; 
                  We seem to have recalled asking him to sit in a chair for 
                  trying to steal a game, and that is what he did.&nbsp; Honest.&nbsp; No 
                  marks on the face...<br>
                  <br>
                  In the end he plead guilty to shoplifting and was sentenced to 
                  40 hours community service or something.</font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><br>
