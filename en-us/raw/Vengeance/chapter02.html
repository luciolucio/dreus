                          night as the Gord was preparing a letter to be sent 
                          off.&nbsp; Then suddenly an individual runs up and kicks 
                          the front door to the store as hard as he can.<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;What the hell is he doing?&quot;</i> thought the Gord 
                          as he stood up.<br>
                          <br>
                          The attacker tried a second time to kick the door 
                          down.&nbsp; Failing that, he turned and left the scene.<br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord was an angry Gord, and the Gord was a 
                          vengeful Gord.<br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord hopped over the counter and exited the 
                          store.&nbsp; He quickly caught up to the two would be 
                          thieves across the street from the staircase exit to a 
                          lower level nightclub.<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;What the hell do you think you're doing?!&quot;</i> 
                          queried the Gord in a most unpleasant fashion.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;We're just walking&quot; was the response.<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Trying to kick down doors is a part of your 
                          walk!?&quot; </i>questioned the Gord.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;You want trouble?&nbsp; You got trouble!&quot; spoke one of the 
                          two individuals that Gord had stopped.&nbsp; The individual 
                          pulled out a metal pipe from his jacket.<br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord was curious why he hadn't used that to try 
                          and take the door down.<br>
                          <br>
                          Anyway, the vandal wasn't very proficient in using a 
                          weapon and levelled it above his head in a threatening 
                          fashion.&nbsp; Fortunately the Gord was trained for just 
                          this scenario.&nbsp; He stepped in, ensured the arm could 
                          not swing the pipe at the Gord while the Gord's other 
                          hand came up and proceeded to send the vandals nose 
                          into his cranium.&nbsp; The stories are true.&nbsp; When you do 
                          that to a person there truly is blood everywhere.<br>
                          <br>
                          While the vandal was dropping back and screaming in 
                          pain as his blood went everywhere, the second vandal 
                          stood in surprise.&nbsp; Before the first&nbsp; person even hits 
                          the ground the Gord side kicked the second person in 
                          the chest and send him careening down a cement 
                          staircase.<br>
                          <br>
                          The conflict was resolved in two hits.&nbsp; The Gord was 2 
                          and 0.<br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord picked up the pipe and returned to the 
                          store.&nbsp; Shortly there after the police and paramedics 
                          arrived.&nbsp; According to one of the officers on the 
                          scene a group of four guys gang beat up the two guys.&nbsp; Or at 
                          least, that was their story.<br>
                          <br>
                          For if you cross the Gord, the Gord shall strike you
