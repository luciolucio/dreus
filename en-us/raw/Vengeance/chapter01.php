                          noon hour at the store as customers are about and all 
                          are happy.&nbsp; Into the store enters a lone individual 
                          who begins to stalk one of the customers. <br>
                          <br>
                          When the moment arrives, the stalker attacks and hits 
                          a lone person in the back of the head and runs for the 
                          exit.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;Nobody beats anyone around here but me&quot; 
                          noted the Gord.&nbsp; He was a very angry, vengeful Gord. 
                          Over 
                          the counter he leapt and outside he went to dish out 
                          the hand of vengeance 
                          on the stalker.&nbsp; The spectators were perplexed as to 
                          what was going on and some only heard the cry of Gord 
                          as he yelled &quot;Hey!&nbsp; Jackass!&nbsp; Get back here!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord exited the store and there awaited a mob of 
                          eight.&nbsp; They had come in search of the one they had 
                          attacked, and were surprised by the hand of Gord.&nbsp; 
                          While outnumbered, the Gord was not stopping.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;Hey you!&nbsp; What the hell you doing!!!&quot; announced the 
                          Gord as he approached the attacker.&nbsp; Sensing danger, 
                          the attacker attempted to back away and proclaimed he 
                          didn't want trouble.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;You don't want trouble?&nbsp; You got trouble!&quot; spoke the 
                          Gord as he grabbed the kid about the jacket and yelled 
                          into his face.<br>
                          <br>
                          At this time a lone individual decided to intervene 
                          and save his friend.&nbsp; For your amusement, he was a 
                          homie who decided to take off his backpack and jacket 
                          and was speaking in homie.&nbsp; The Gord let the punk go 
                          and approached the lone individual who sought to save 
                          his friend.<br>
                          <br>
                          When they stood toe to toe, the Gord leaned forward 
                          and whispered so that only the homie could hear.&nbsp; He 
                          spoke &quot;Pick up your backpack and walk away or I will 
                          break your nose and let you bleed all over yourself to 
                          serve as an example to the others.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          The homie decided he was rather fond of his clothes 
                          and his nose.&nbsp; So he turned around, picked up his 
                          stuff and walked away, leaving his friend to fend for 
                          himself.<br>
                          <br>
                          The punk who started it all was attempting to exit the 
                          scene.&nbsp; The Gord quickly caught up to him and began to 
                          announce his displeasure at the scenario at hand.<br>
                          <br>
                          While the punk proclaimed he wasn't afraid of the 
                          Gord, his backing up into a wall and profuse shaking 
                          suggested otherwise.<br>
                          <br>
                          In the end the punk apologized and claimed the whole 
                          scenario was a misunderstanding.&nbsp; In exchange for not 
                          having any painful move done to him, he vowed not to 
                          seek retribution on the individual he originally 
                          attacked.<br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord spared him.&nbsp; <br>
                          <br>
                          The Gord is a vengeful Gord.&nbsp; Love the Gord, fear the
