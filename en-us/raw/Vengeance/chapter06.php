                  Nintendo 64 lodged in the frame.&nbsp; And people are flocking 
                  to the outside in the warmth of the approaching summer.<p align="left">
                  Into the store rides our friend, the customer who always comes 
                  in to Gord's store, checks everything out, annoy's Gord with 
                  many questions, and never buys anything from Gord.&nbsp; Not 
                  once in recorded history.&nbsp; He was very much in the &quot;very 
                  annoying&quot; class.<p align="left">And by riding into the store, 
                  I mean that literally.&nbsp; He rides his bike into the middle 
                  of the store and parks it in the middle.<p align="left"><i>
                  &quot;You know, we discussed this last time that I have a bike rack 
                  outside for a reason.&quot;</i><p align="left">&quot;But I'm afraid it 
                  might get stolen.&quot;<p align="left"><i>&quot;Perhaps if you used your 
                  bike lock that's on your bike at this very instance.&quot;</i><p align="left">
                  &quot;That's too much work.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Is that Perfect Dark?&nbsp; 
                  Can I play?&quot;<p align="left"><i>&quot;No.&nbsp; That's reserved for 
                  paying customers.&quot;</i><p align="left">&quot;I'm a paying customer.&quot;<p align="left">
                  <i>&quot;What's your phone number?&nbsp; I'll check your account.&quot;</i><p align="left">
                  &quot;Uhm... it won't be in there.&quot;<p align="left"><i>&quot;I know that.&nbsp; 
                  It was a rhetorical question.&quot;</i><p align="left">&quot;I'll just 
                  go back there and watch then.&quot;<p align="left"><i>&quot;Might I 
                  suggest you move your bike then, perhaps somewhere like the 
                  bike rack?&quot;</i><p align="left">&quot;It will be ok right there.&quot;<p align="left">
                  <i>&quot;It's in the middle of my store.&quot;</i><p align="left">But 
                  deaf ears those words fell on.&nbsp; Anyway, customer walks in 
                  as this was happening, so Gord wasn't able to push the issue.&nbsp; 
                  Paying customer picks up game they ordered.&nbsp; Paying 
                  customer hits bike with purse when they are turning around.&nbsp; 
                  It almost falls on her nice clothes and other bag on the 
                  ground.<p align="left">&quot;Oh!&nbsp; I'm so sorry!&quot;<p align="left">
                  <i>&quot;That's ok ma'am.&nbsp; Let me take care of that.&quot;</i><p align="left">
                  Gord yells to non-paying customer <i>&quot;Your bike fell over!&quot;</i><p align="left">
                  &quot;That's ok.&nbsp; I'll pick it up when I go back up front.&quot;<p align="left">
                  Gord decides to walk around the counter and picks up the bike.&nbsp; 
                  Then Gord carries it to the door, out the door, and then 
                  tosses it 15 feet sending it crashing along the cement in 
                  front of the store.<p align="left">&quot;What the hell are you 
                  doing!?&quot; screams the non-paying customer as he runs up front.<p align="left">
                  <i>&quot;You're bike fell over twice.&nbsp; It landed just outside 
                  and to your left on the second time.&quot;</i><p align="left">
                  &lt;profanities ensue.&gt;<p align="left">
                  <i>&quot;Does this mean you've learned that using bike racks will 
                  prevent your bike from falling?&quot;</i><p align="left">&quot;Next time I see you, I'm 
                  going to kick your ass!&quot;<p align="left"><i>&quot;Oh no!&nbsp; Not 
                  'next time!'&nbsp; Anything but 'next time!'&nbsp; Much better 
                  than 'oh, right now.'&nbsp; Have a good day.&nbsp; Bike's to
