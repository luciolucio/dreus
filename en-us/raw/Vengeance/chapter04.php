                  <font face="Times New Roman">One local thief who was kicked 
                  out of the store was sitting out front one day.&nbsp; Since it was 
                  somewhat busy the Gord didn't care.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then a customer informed the Gord that the kid was trying to 
                  sell marijuana to anyone who walked in.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Gord went outside to confront the young punk, but alas he 
                  was gone.<br>
                  <br>
                  But as fate would have it, the next day the Gord spotted the 
                  young punk as he was out for a walk doing an errand.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Hey!&nbsp; You!&nbsp; Little bitch!&quot; </i>as Gord ran up to him and 
                  confronted him.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Shut the fuck up!&quot; spoke the punk in front of his friend and 
                  his friends mother.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Gord grabbed the punk and &lt;BAM&gt;!&nbsp; Backhand against the 
                  face.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Show some respect little bitch!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Fuck you!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;BAM!&gt;&nbsp; and another backhand was delivered.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Show some 
                  respect!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Fuck you, you can't do that!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;BAM&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Speak when spoken to little bitch!!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  The punk finally shuts up, and the other friend's mother goes 
                  in on how I can't do that.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ma'am, little bitch here was selling pot in front of my 
                  store to minors.&nbsp; Quite frankly, I can do whatever I want to 
                  him.&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;No I wasn't.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;BAM&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;That's for lying little bitch!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Everyone goes quiet.&nbsp; So Gord begins informing the punk if he 
                  ever sees him in front of his store ever again, the hand of 
                  Gord will be brought down on him.<br>
                  <br>
                  Some people never learn.<br>
                  <br>
                  Next day, the punk walks by in front of the store with a 
                  friend and yells obscenities at the Gord.&nbsp; The Gord hops the 
                  counter and catches up to the punk as he walks down the 
                  street.&nbsp; Gord spins him around by his shoulders and &lt;BAM&gt;, the 
                  backhand of justice was laid down.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You can't do that!&quot; spoke the friend and he stepped in to 
                  save his punk friend.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Show respect, lest you will become what you seek to 
                  protect!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;What?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Never mind.&nbsp; You can't handle it.&nbsp; And you, little bitch!&nbsp; 
                  If I ever see you again in front of my store, we'll do this 
                  exercise over again!&quot;</i><br>
                  <br>
                  And never again did he walk in front of the store.</font></td>
