                  <font face="Times New Roman">So stuff gets stolen.&nbsp; Gord does 
                  what he can to control it.&nbsp; There is damn near no live stock 
                  on the floor and people sometimes just don't bring back 
                  rentals.&nbsp; It happens.&nbsp; They get sent to collections and their 
                  credit shot, but it's all in the context of doing business.&nbsp; 
                  It's never personal, I assume they aren't coming in to steal 
                  from Gord personally.<br>
                  <br>
                  One buddy decides to make it personal one day.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  So buddy comes into the store and sits down by the window 
                  where there was a tres cool super deformed Solid Snake and 
                  Merrill covering his eyes.&nbsp; Trust me, it was a beauty.&nbsp; The 
                  Gord didn't pay attention to what he was doing as there was 
                  nothing really over there and there were customers in the 
                  store.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then he migrates over to the used Genesis games, and finally 
                  leaves.<br>
                  <br>
                  When he left a regular noted that buddy had stolen a game.&nbsp; 
                  When checked, he had stolen David Robinson's Supreme Court.&nbsp; 
                  It was priced at $2.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then Gord noticed that buddy had scratched a good chunk of the 
                  mural in the window.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only had he stole a crap game to 
                  prove he could, and vandalized the store.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  The Gord was enflamed with rage and swore that he would find 
                  the person and revenge would be extracted!&nbsp; He would not rest 
                  until the retribution was at hand.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Gord quickly learned that the thief and vandal worked at a 
                  local department store.&nbsp; He went down there that night and 
                  found the thief working.&nbsp; Rather than simply confronting the 
                  thief as that wouldn't be enough, Gord masterminded a 
                  brilliant plan that children still sing songs about to this 
                  day.<br>
                  <br>
                  He went up and made sure to talk to the thief for a couple 
                  minutes for the security camera, then he made sure to take an 
                  item from the department he worked in to the cashier.<br>
                  <br>
                  With his purchase in hand, Gord proceeded to the customer 
                  service desk and went into a huge story about how the &quot;Mike in 
                  Gardening&quot; was rude to him, told him to &quot;fuck off&quot; and made 
                  sexual comments to the female companion that was with Gord.&nbsp; 
                  Another employee vouched for what happened (a friend of Gord 
                  who was working there at the time), and customer service 
                  offered to give the Gord his purchase for free (Gord declined, 
                  as then that would be theft and Gord would be no better than 
                  those Gord sought to destroy).<br>
                  <br>
                  Seems management was VERY angry with our thief Mike here and 
                  was promptly fired.<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord is a contentious Gord.&nbsp; Fear the Gord and do not cross 
                  the Gord.&nbsp; He who sows injustice will reap calamity, and the 
                  rod of his fury will fail. Embrace the Gord.</font></td>
