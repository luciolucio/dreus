                  Galdstaff, sorcerer of light!&quot; &quot;Then why'd you have to use

                  <br>
                  &quot;Hello Michael from Gamer's Edge in Nanaimo.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  </i>&quot;We have a problem.&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;You received another one of my packages?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  (a couple week prior a package containing some 40 games from a 
                  distributor was sent to the Nanaimo Gamer's Edge instead of 
                  Gord's accidentally. --ed).<br>
                  <br>
                  </i>&quot;You're using my name, Gamer's Edge!&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;Technically, I'm using my name Gamer's Edge that you have 
                  decided you rather like.&nbsp; When did you start using the name?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  </i>&quot;In December of last year.&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;So, in total some eight months.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  </i>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;And I've been using the name for three years.&nbsp; So just how is 
                  it that I'm stealing your name, when you're clearing stealing 
                  my name?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  </i>&quot;I registered the trademark!&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;I see.&nbsp; Not withstanding that registering a trademark simply 
                  sets a date at which time you were to begin using the 
                  trademark.&nbsp; This does not circumvent any prior use of the said 
                  trademark by other parties prior to the registration of the 
                  said trademark.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  </i>Anyway, Mike from Gamer's Edge in Nanaimo was getting 
                  pretty pissed.&nbsp; Since everything wasn't going his way, Gord 
                  was fast becoming the anti-Christ.<br>
                  <br>
                  But Gord wasn't evil.&nbsp; And since he just moved from the old 
                  store to the new store, he thought about surrendering the name 
                  and such to Mike for a token momentary amount.&nbsp; Gord had no 
                  emotional attachment to the name.<br>
                  <br>
                  Mike was having none of this.&nbsp; He was of the belief he was in 
                  the right, and that god himself was going to lead him to 
                  righteousness.<br>
                  <br>
                  And then came the &quot;I'll get my lawyer involved.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I'll save him the call, what's his name and number?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Surprisingly, Mike actually had a name and number.&nbsp; So Gord 
                  called up the lawyer.&nbsp; And called the lawyer.&nbsp; And called the 
                  lawyer again.&nbsp; After about four calls over a period of a few 
                  days, Gord finally got al hold of the lawyer who wasn't 
                  returning any calls.<br>
                  <br>
                  Turns out the lawyer wasn't being an ass, but honestly had no 
                  idea why Gord was calling him as Mike didn't pass word on that 
                  Gord was trying to get a hold of him.<br>
                  <br>
                  So Gord and the lawyer had a good talk.&nbsp; It was friendly, 
                  social, and involved both of them laughing at Mike.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the end, Mike changed his name to &quot;Gamer's Edge Games and 
                  Gear.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Though if Gord feels evil one day, he'll send in the trademark 
                  police and bring the heat down on his operation….&nbsp; </font>
