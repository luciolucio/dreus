                  So there was Gord minding the store, when the call came from 
                  his local collection company.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Ya, about that crazy Stephanie Schneider woman.&nbsp; Apparently, 
                  she's moving out of province according to her employer.&quot; 
                  [note: at this time, my collection company really was 
                  borderline incompetent.&nbsp; Nice people, just really useless.&nbsp; 
                  Very much in favour of the soft approach.]<br>
                  <br>
                  Good old Stephanie.&nbsp; Comes in, signs up a new account just 
                  after Gord had moved the store to a new location, and then 
                  rents two games.&nbsp; Then she never returns.&nbsp; No one ever answers 
                  her phone and such. The one time Gord managed to get someone 
                  at her place, it was &quot;we'll bring them down on Tuesday as she 
                  really likes them.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Then once it was turned over to collections, it was &quot;never 
                  been to the store&quot;, &quot;never rents games&quot;, and eventually &quot;You 
                  can't prove I ever rented a game.&quot;&nbsp; Whatever, enjoy your 
                  credit being shot.&nbsp; Her mother would be so proud!<br>
                  <br>
                  Next morning before Gord heads on down to the empire, Gord 
                  gave her a call from his place as they both live in the same 
                  nearby town.&nbsp; And boom!&nbsp; She answers.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;So, what's up?&nbsp; Any particular reason you're refusing to 
                  pay?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm moving to Alberta!&nbsp; There is nothing you can do to me!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ma'am.&nbsp; Never say never to the Gord.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &lt;click&gt; (Gord ends the call).<br>
                  <br>
                  To the courthouse!&nbsp; Then to the store to grab a witness, then 
                  to Stephanie's house!<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord pulls up to her place.&nbsp; Moving truck in the yard, her car 
                  still there (she lives two doors down from Gord's favourite 
                  sub place in the world, so he had seen the place many a time).<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord and the witness walk up to the door.<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;ding dong&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  Woman comes to the door.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Stephanie?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Stephanie Schneider?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You've been served.&nbsp; Good day.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not Stephanie!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Err, what?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not Stephanie.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Yes you are.&nbsp; I recognize you.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;No I'm not.&nbsp; I'm the new tenant.&nbsp; Stephanie moved already.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;That's odd.&nbsp; People usually don't move and leave a moving 
                  van with all their stuff in it and their car behind.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Uhm… ya.&nbsp; She left.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Then who are you?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm the new tenant?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Oh really?&nbsp; May I see your ID?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Why, so you can see who I am?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I know who you are.&nbsp; I want you to prove you're not.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not showing you my ID.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I'm not surprised there Stephanie.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not Stephanie.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;If you say so.&nbsp; Anyway, you've been served.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not taking those.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;That's fine.&nbsp; I'll just leave them on the door frame 
                  here.&nbsp; It's not my problem anymore.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Gord and the witness walk away.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm not Stephanie.. I'm not Stephanie!!!!!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Dramatic pause&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Fuck you!&nbsp; Fuck you both!&nbsp; You'll never see a dime from me!&quot;
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Further vulgarities ensued from sweet Stephanie.&nbsp; Stephanie 
                  then throws the court papers all over the road.<br>
                  <br>
                  Gord waves at her, winks, and blows a kiss as he drives off.<br>
                  <br>
                  The waiting game begins.<br>
                  <br>
                  Eventually Gord get her response from the court papers.&nbsp; Seems 
                  she has decided to go with the &quot;never rented the games, but 
                  rather bought this game that don't exist.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  So,&nbsp; the settlement hearing comes up.&nbsp; She's an angry woman.&nbsp; 
                  Never going to pay, Gord's making this up to personally ruin 
                  her life, and she's a good little girl who volunteers every 
                  Sunday to help the needy and gives money to orphanages (well, 
                  ok, that last part was made up).<br>
                  <br>
                  Then comes… the trial!<br>
                  <br>
                  So she has to spend 12 hours on the road to come to this 
                  trial.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; That was much better than simply paying me the 
                  $180 she owed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ah the trial.&nbsp; You'd think if you were going to sit there and 
                  lie your way to freedom, you'd at least use only one story.<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, first she comes up with the magical game she bought 
                  from me.&nbsp; At that time, I used a counterfeiting pen to mark my 
                  used games (that way someone didn't buy a game, and then 
                  return their broken one saying the one they bought from me was 
                  defective).&nbsp; Since she didn't know about that (as almost no 
                  one did), it showed that the game didn't come from me.<br>
                  <br>
                  Second, I noted to the judge that I had her personal ID info 
                  and ID #'s on file.&nbsp; She tried to get around this one a couple 
                  times.&nbsp; First, she claimed she needed to show ID to buy a game 
                  (we all laughed at that one).&nbsp; Second, the judged asked for 
                  her ID to confirm the #'s.&nbsp; She tried to use her new Alberta 
                  ID.&nbsp; So the judge asked her for her old B.C. ID.&nbsp; Well, guess 
                  that numbers matched?<br>
                  <br>
                  Then we get to the serving part of the story.&nbsp; That whole 
                  &quot;Fuck you, you'll never get a dime from me&quot; statement was 
                  pretty damning.&nbsp; Plus I noted that the residence was empty for 
                  the next month, so it seemed odd that their would be a new 
                  tenant.&nbsp; And since she had told the court she had not been 
                  served, it furthered added to her perjury <br>
                  <br>
                  In the end, the judge commented on her rather sad state of 
                  affairs and that she should be thankful that she wasn't going 
                  to be going to jail for a week for perjury as Stephanie agreed 
                  to pay the court judgment within 3 weeks without a payment 
                  schedule.&nbsp; So, cost to replace games, late fees, and all court 
                  costs.</font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><br>
