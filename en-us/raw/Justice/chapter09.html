                  &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot;<p><i>&quot;Well, I was looking at 
                  the map there.&nbsp; Specifically Oceania, and wondering how 
                  people managed to colonize it by sitting in little canoes and 
                  hoping they hit land.&nbsp; And of course, listening to 
                  Blumchen.&nbsp; While she is singing in German as you can 
                  hear, I am told by a German that she is in actually from 
                  England.&nbsp; That's just crazy enough to work if it's true.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I meant this note from your collection company.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Next time, say what you mean.&nbsp; I answered the 
                  question you asked.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You sent me to collections of a game I didn't return.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Ok.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You can't do that!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;I would raise the obvious point that I have already 
                  done that, and in fact you are holding the evidence to support 
                  my cause.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You see I filed for bankruptcy four years ago, so none of 
                  this applies.&nbsp; Take it back.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Four years ago?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;And the game was rented when?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;December.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Filing for a court protected bankruptcy shields you 
                  from existing creditors and strikes your debts in exchange for 
                  a liquidation of most of your assets.&nbsp; It allows you to 
                  recover from a negative net worth and affords you the ability 
                  to try and rebuild you life.&nbsp; It is not a licence to 
                  steal games, nor is it forward acting towards new debts.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I can't have this on my credit!&nbsp; I'm trying to 
                  rebuild my credit.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Not to be an ass, but I would like to point out you are 
                  in fact a poor credit risk.&nbsp; While my example is limited 
                  to one variable, that being of you stealing a game from me, I 
                  do believe it is valid in characterizing your value as a 
                  person.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You'll have to sue!&nbsp; And the courts will rule in 
                  favour of me.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;As the person here with the greatest experience in 
                  suing people, I would say you are existing in a state of 
                  denial.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;If you sue, it'll cost you more than what you'll get from 
                  me.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;No, I'll get all court costs added to the award.&nbsp; 
                  It all comes from your pocket.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I'm never coming back!&quot;</p>
