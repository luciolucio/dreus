                  <i>&quot;Good day.&quot;</i><p>&quot;What's this about you claiming I stole 
                  your PlayStation!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Actually, all I did was an older English polite version 
                  of 'hello'.&nbsp; 'Good day' means 'hello' as saying 'hello' 
                  to someone you weren't formally introduced to prior was 
                  considered impolite in the 19th century.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You told the police I stole your PlayStation!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Very well then.&nbsp; What is your phone number as I 
                  have no idea who you are.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I don't have an account here.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Then I would suggest the claim that I told the police 
                  you stole my PlayStation would be a conjecture of your 
                  imagination.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I pawned my PlayStation, and when I went to pick it up, 
                  they said it was stolen from here.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Very well then, how about I phone and ask what's going 
                  on.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&lt;Gord phones the department of the police that handles 
                  property crime.&nbsp; It seems that the system in question was 
                  stolen a year earlier by someone who cancelled the card after 
                  renting.&nbsp; The system was reported stolen [and serial # 
                  given in case it ever turned up at a pawn shop] and the 
                  address the person gave was also false.&nbsp; They were 
                  holding it for me, and just hadn't brought it down yet.&nbsp; 
                  So in fact it was stolen, just not by her.&gt;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Well, that solves that problem.&nbsp; That machine was 
                  stolen by someone a year ago.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Give it back to me or I'll sue!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;First, it's not even here yet.&nbsp; Second, sue me for 
                  what?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;That system wasn't yours anymore!&nbsp; I legally bought 
                  it!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Property ownership does not legally end at the unlawful 
                  removal of the property via theft.&nbsp; And as such, all 
                  future implied ownership transfers are on their face false, as 
                  my ownership is still the one that is accepted before the 
                  law.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I'll sue!&nbsp; I own it!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;You'll sue for what I may ask?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;To get it back!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Under what act of the law will you use?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;uhm....&nbsp; I'll get a lawyer!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;You'll spend $175 an hour on a hopeless cause for a 
                  $140 machine that you bought used?&nbsp; Oh, and welfare 
                  doesn't play for lawyers.&nbsp; A court only gives you a 
                  lawyer if you are being criminally charged.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&lt;pause&gt;</p>
                  <p>&quot;You haven't heard the last of me!&quot;</p>
