                  the Gord, the police, and some of the City's laws being tossed 
                  out.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it also guest starred an idiot mother and her 
                  genetically repressed child.<br>
                  <br>
                  Our story begins on a quite Tuesday morning a little after 11 
                  am.&nbsp; The scene, the shop keeper (Gord) has just opened up and 
                  he is reading the mail and sorting night returns.&nbsp; Enter the 
                  scene, a child who looks the age of 14. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Excuse me, do you have any Gameboy games?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Sure.&nbsp; Here's the box of them.&nbsp; You can look through 
                  them.&nbsp; If you need anything, just let me know.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Child paws through the box for a few minutes then asks &quot;what 
                  is a Gameboy Colour worth to trade in?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;About $45.&nbsp; A bit more if you have the box and such.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;And cash?&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;About $25.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'll take the cash please.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Are you sure?&nbsp; You get more for credit than you do for 
                  cash.&quot;<br>

                  &quot;Cash please.&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;Very well then.&nbsp; Here you go.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Child exits the scene…&nbsp; Per usual, Gord filed the Gameboy into 
                  the drawer in case the parents got pissed or something.<br>
                  <br>
                  ...9 days later…<br>

                  &quot;Yes, my son sold you his GameBoy Colour a couple days ago.&quot;&nbsp; 
                  (in a friendly tone)<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Yes, I was here for that transaction.&quot;<br>

                  <i>&quot;Very well then.&nbsp; It's here.&nbsp; Just bring down the $25 I 
                  paid him for it and you can have it back.&quot;<br>

                  (friendly tone becomes evil tone)<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm NOT paying for it!&nbsp; You're going to give it back to me!&nbsp; 
                  I'm going to keep your $25 to teach you a lesson!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Teach me a lesson?&quot;<br>

                  &quot;Give $25 for a machine worth $100!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ma'am,&nbsp; I gave $25 cash for a used machine that sells new 
                  for $100.&nbsp; However, I offered twice to give him $45 credit for 
                  the same machine.&nbsp; Your son decided he wanted the lesser 
                  amount in a cash form.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm coming down right now!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You do that.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &lt;20 minutes later&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  Angry woman storms into the store.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm here for my son's GameBoy colour!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I'm sorry, it's not here.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;WHAT?!?!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Yes, it was mistakenly sold a few minutes ago.&nbsp; Tragic 
                  accident really.&nbsp; So sorry.&nbsp; And we were so wanting to return 
                  it to you because your son was raised by you and we understand 
                  now why he turned out as he did.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;That's illegal!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;No, what's illegal is you trying to extort me.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm going to call the police.&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;You do that.&nbsp; You can explain how your son and I engaged in a 
                  legal transaction of a fair value to both parties and that you 
                  attempted to extort me.&nbsp; That'll go over well.&nbsp; If you don't 
                  mind, I have other customers to serve.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  (the store is completely empty and silent at this point, no 
                  music at all, and the TV wasn't on).<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; and she storms out.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Close of Act 1.&nbsp; Begin Act 2.<br>
                  </b><br>
                  One day has passed since the close of Act 1, and enter the 
                  police into the store accompanied by the child in the story.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;We understand there is a problem.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;And what would that problem be?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;That you stole his child's Gameboy.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;That's not quite how I remember it happening.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;We're told that you threatened him.&nbsp; You came up to him, 
                  demanded he sell you his Gameboy Colour for $25 and threatened 
                  to beat him, and then you kicked him.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;This would be an example of a false police report being 
                  filed.&nbsp; I find threatening kids to be a bad way of doing 
                  business as they would never come back.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Do you know the Pawn shop laws?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Can't say I do.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Well, there are a lot of rules that apply.&nbsp; And that they say 
                  you can't deal with anyone under 18 and that you will have to 
                  file a report to us every morning of all the used games you 
                  get in.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Would this be a bad time to point out I'm a video game 
                  store and not a pawn shop?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Anyway, this goes on for a bit.&nbsp; So afterwards I get the pawn 
                  shop laws brought over to me and start to do the big read 
                  over.&nbsp; Seems that was he was saying was right, except for one 
                  small part.&nbsp; The law itself was illegal.&nbsp; The provincial laws 
                  clearly outline what the rules are they give a section for 
                  cities to tighten them if they want.&nbsp; The City of Penticton 
                  went way beyond the scope of that act and basically said that 
                  no business could do trades with anyone under 18, and that any 
                  business that did bring in used stuff would have to hold it 
                  for 30 days and file police listings every morning.&nbsp; The law 
                  stepped way beyond the authority given to the city under the 
                  Pawn Shop Act.<br>
                  <br>
                  After a couple days the heat returns…<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I noticed you haven't filed any reports yet.&nbsp; I could fine 
                  you $100 a day.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I noticed that you aren't requiring any of the car lots in 
                  town to hold their used cars for 30 days before they sell 
                  them, or that any computer stores are holding their product 
                  for 30 days.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;They don't have to.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;According the to law you want to use on me they do, here 
                  you go.&nbsp; I've highlighted the important passages.&nbsp; But it 
                  doesn't matter, the law on it's face is invalid as the statute 
                  that allows the city to expand on the restrictions clearly 
                  states that it only applies to Pawn Shops, and that statue 
                  also states what a pawn shop is.&nbsp; I don't fit the 
                  description.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not a lawyer.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I know. &quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Just start faxing in the lists.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;No.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'll fine you!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Oh that'll go over well.&nbsp; I tell you why the law in 
                  invalid, and you retaliate by fining me.&nbsp; That'll go over well 
                  then I write a letter to the city about your action.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  This went on for a few minutes.&nbsp; Finally he left, never to 
                  return.&nbsp; The city pawn shop law was tossed out, and we all 
                  played the Gameboy Colour until I finally sold it one day 
                  because the batteries died. <br>
                  <br>
                  There was more to the story, but it's long enough already.&nbsp; If 
                  enough people ask I'll go back and fill in a lot of the parts 
                  that are missing or were skipped over.&nbsp; While I rather like 
                  Act 2 for for intellectual prowess, the end of the first act 
                  and the start of the second act is the best part.&nbsp; There is 
                  more if you want it…<br>
                  <br>
                  And in one last footnote.&nbsp; One the officers who tried to 
                  shakedown the operation here was brought down and arrested in 
                  February of 2001 for selling drugs and stealing evidence.&nbsp; 
                  Maybe he just wanted to bring the Gameboy Colour in for 
                  evidence so he could steal it…&nbsp; But I'll never know.</font></td>
