                  The setting: Wednesday morning on welfare day.&nbsp; How people on 
                  welfare can afford games, I don't know.&nbsp; But they buy a lot.&nbsp; 
                  Much better than food or shelter I guess.<br>
                  <br>
                  Remember the Far Side where the kid is at the school for the 
                  gifted and he's trying to push on the door when it's labeled 
                  pull?&nbsp; Well, this one kid was trying for two minutes to do the 
                  same thing at Gord's door.&nbsp; Oh this was going to hurt when the 
                  rest of the family showed up.<br>
                  <br>
                  Finally the mother shows up with a second child and they enter 
                  the store.&nbsp; Around and around they go until they have around 8 
                  or 9 games they want to rent and then they come up to the counter.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Yes, I want to rent these games.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Do you have an account here?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;No I do not.&nbsp; What does it take to sign up an account?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;A piece of government picture ID and either a credit card 
                  or a social insurance card.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  She then tosses down an expired intern drivers license with no 
                  picture.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ma'am, that is neither government picture ID nor is it a 
                  credit card nor is it a social insurance card.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &lt;now she starts yelling&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;If I'm pulled over in my car and I give that as ID they'll 
                  know it's me!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ma'am, if you were pulled over in your car and you provide 
                  insurance papers and an intern drivers license, then yes, 
                  they'll assume that it's you.&nbsp; However, you are not in your 
                  car and I don't see any insurance papers. Plus it's expired.&nbsp; 
                  You'd be given a $100 fine for driving without a license and 
                  your vehicle towed.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Just rent me the games!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You'll need an account.&nbsp; Perhaps a deposit can be made?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm going to take my business elsewhere where I am 
                  appreciated!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You do that.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm going to Video Update!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You do that.&nbsp; They charge $5 a day, I charge $5 a week.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  And at this time she storms out.&nbsp; Only she left her brilliant 
                  son behind.&nbsp; Then she yells at him to hurry up, and so he 
                  makes a break for the door.&nbsp; Only when he got there the woman 
                  decided to slam the door to make a scene and promptly slammed 
                  it into her son.&nbsp; Ass over tea kettle is the phrase.&nbsp; I'm 
                  surprised there wasn't blood everywhere, he was sent 
                  flipping.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Then she comes storming back in, grabs her kid who is now in a 
                  state of shock and drags him outside.&nbsp; &quot;Man, this lady is 
                  messed&quot; pondered Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  And 30 second later she comes storming back in and yelling.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm going to phone the city on you!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;For what?&nbsp; Oh no, I won't let someone rent games without 
                  ID?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm going to phone the police!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Hello?&nbsp; 911?&nbsp; The game store won't rent me any games 
                  without ID or a deposit!&nbsp; Arrest his ass!&nbsp; Now!&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm going to phone the paper!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Here, I'll phone them and they can come down to talk to us.&nbsp; 
                  Maybe you'll make the front page for your sheer intellectual 
                  prowess.&nbsp; Will you pose for the picture?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'll phone the government on you!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>(and now it gets really good.&nbsp; Sheer brilliance on this 
                  one).<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &lt;and Gord does this in a shocked, scared and shaking voice&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Oh please… no.&nbsp; Don't do that, please.&nbsp; They'll shut me 
                  down!&nbsp; Please, I beg of you and implore you not to do that.&nbsp; 
                  Whatever you do, don't call the 'Bureau of Video Games and 
                  Customer Service.'&nbsp; I've already got my one warning, and if 
                  they get another complaint they'll shut me down…&nbsp; please, 
                  don't…&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Yes, that's exactly who I am going to phone!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Are you sure?&nbsp; Look, here is their number.&nbsp; (Gord writes down 
                  my store phone number).&nbsp; Please, don't…&nbsp; I'll be closed down.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;You should have thought of that before you didn't rent to 
                  me!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  And she storms out… Let the waiting begin.</font><i><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><br>
