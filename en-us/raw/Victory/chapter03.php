                          The Return of Crazy Lady!<br>
                          <br>
                          So there Gord was, average day, and a woman rents a 
                          couple games and promises to pay the late fees next 
                          time she rents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary&nbsp; 
                          She then leaves with her games.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;Gord! That was her!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Who?&quot;<br>
                          </i><br>
                          &quot;The crazy lady!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Really?&quot;<br>
                          </i><br>
                          At this point it had been six months since the 
                          incident.&nbsp; Her husband signed up an account 2 weeks 
                          prior and rented a couple games that were late coming 
                          back. <br>
                          <br>
                          Long story short, the games she had were also late and 
                          in the end I was owed some $80 in late fees.&nbsp; At a $1 
                          a day per game, that takes a while.<br>
                          <br>
                          Eventually it was forwarded to collections (accounts 
                          that go inactive for six months and owe more than $20 
                          are forwarded to collections).<br>
