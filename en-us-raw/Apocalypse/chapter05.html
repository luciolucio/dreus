                  hours later an instant message arrived on Gord’s computer.&nbsp; It 
                  was polite in asking “what’s up?”.&nbsp; Gord was equally polite 
                  with his <i>“You have been removed.”</i></span></p>

                  Sadly, things  spoke from The Assistant were far less 
                  polite. Having lost the opportunity to acquire thousands of 
                  dollars worth of assets for mere pennies on the&nbsp;dollar, he 
                  promised far and wide  should Gord ever return that a violent 
                  event would befall him.&nbsp; How dare Gord stop him from stealing 
                  all of Gord’s stuff!</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">As 
                  for the Agent, she was fired from her job.&nbsp; That was the last 
                  Gord ever heard of her.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">After 
                  a few days, the Guardian did try his hand at filing a civil 
                  suit against Gord’s father as Gord was unreachable and tried 
                  to take ownership of some assets from the store he claimed 
                  were his.&nbsp; Eventually the court dismissed the case and offered 
                  to punitively punish the Guardian for perpetuating a fraud 
                  upon the court, but after watching the Guardian lose so much 
                  and be left with so little it was thought best to just leave 
                  him be.&nbsp; He had been railroaded by the greed of those around 
                  him and there was little reason to punish him for the 
                  rest of this life simply because he chose to believe the lies 
                  of others.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Eventually, much of the inventory was sold off or boxed up for 
                  nostalgic reasons.&nbsp; Other assets, like the TV were loaned out 
                  to loving homes.&nbsp; And things like the shelving units were kept 
                  stacked for use in a future venture.</span></p>

                  Whatever became of Gord?&nbsp; After he went through the door on 
                  his right, he never did return to open another game store.&nbsp; 
                  Instead, his one year planned working holiday in Asia was 
                  indefinitely extended.&nbsp; His overseas adventure has not a 
                  simple one, and much like the time at the game store, chaos 
                  and excitement followed him to Asia to embrace him. </span>

                  another Book of Gord one day be written?&nbsp; Perhaps.&nbsp; But for
