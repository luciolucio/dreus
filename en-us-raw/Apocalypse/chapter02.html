                  Within days of Gord's departure, the landlord agent arrived to 
                  greet The Guardian again.&nbsp; Though this time she brought not a 
                  message of hope and joy, but rather a message of despair and 
                  concern. She claimed that the store not only owed tens of 
                  thousands in unpaid rent (a total equivalent to 70% of the 
                  rent bill over 3 years), but that because The Guardian was 
                  running the store while The Gord was overseas that the debt 
                  now fell to him.&nbsp; Further still, she threatened that this 
                  amount would be forcibly collected by the landlord taking 
                  everything that the Guardian owned or had ever touched.<br>
                  <br>
                  Greatly concerned, The Guardian spoke to The Gord about this. 
                  The Gord noted that the rent claim was false as it would have 
                  meant that rent was not paid for over 2 years, but that even 
                  if such a debt did exist that it would be Gord's 
                  responsibility. Gord briefly explained contract law and how 
                  The Guardian had nothing to fear, and even if the landlord 
                  agent pushed the issue the only thing they could do would be 
                  to evict the store as they could not do a seizure as no lease 
                  agreement was in place. &nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">&quot;If 
                  they honestly believe that I owe that much money, they can 
                  bill me.&quot;</span></i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Legally, the only options open to the landlord should such a 
                  debt exist were eviction (in which no seizure could be made as 
                  the lease agreement had long expired and provincial law only 
                  allows for a seizure of assets for rent arrears when a lease 
                  agreement is in place that has a definite starting and ending 
                  date) or citing abandonment of the premises and doing a 
                  seizure.&nbsp; Obviously tossing Gord’s stuff out onto the street 
                  wouldn’t really accomplish much for anyone as it would simply 
                  reduce the rental income from the store to zero in a building 
                  that was already half empty, but if a seizure could be 
                  orchestrated successfully it would be payday for everyone 
                  involved.</span></p>

                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">Gord 
                  returned to his riding and exploring.<br>
                  <br>
                  But back in the homeland, things continue to spiral downward. 
                  In the past, The landlord himself had met Gord only once. The 
                  reason for this was that he was suffering from a degenerative 
                  disease and had departed to California to a hospital in the 
                  hope that they could help him. But all was for naught, and his 
                  condition slowly worsened. As he was out of the country, the 
                  landlord agent was hired and given free reign to run the 
                  building. And free reign was the order of the day as rent 
                  money given to her failed to arrive in the bank account of the 
                  landlord for the full amount. She had been taking cash for 
                  rent and writing a receipt, then creating a new receipt for 
                  the rent ledger and pocketing the difference. <br>
                  <br>
                  Around the time of Gord's departure, the family of the 
                  landlord had taken an interest in the finances of the building 
                  &nbsp;and noticed that a certain game store that appeared to have a 
                  lot of games and other inventory appeared to be some 2 years 
                  behind in the rent.&nbsp; They requested that something be done.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Undaunted by the rule of law, The Agent pushed the lie that 
                  they were getting ready to seize the store and sue The Guardian 
                  for money owed. The Guardian was ignorant of how the law works 
                  in such matters, and upon the advice of others also not versed 
                  in law decided to capitalize on the moment.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  But to orchestrate such an event, it would take an organized 
                  conspiracy.&nbsp; Thus a fine conspiracy involving three was born.&nbsp; 
                  The Guardian, The Landlord Agent, and The Assistant to The 
                  Guardian.</span></p>
