                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">It 
                  was July.&nbsp; Much like many other evenings after the store had 
                  closed the doors to commerce, the back social area remained 
                  busy.&nbsp; Cards, computers, drinks, and a movie.&nbsp; A fine evening 
                  worthy of song and dance slowly unfolded.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  During the evening’s conversation, two of the visitors spoke 
                  of how they sought to head overseas to work.&nbsp; Gord noted that 
                  one of his friends had a brother who had done that previously 
                  and quite enjoyed the experience.&nbsp; The entertainment and 
                  socialization was suspended for a while and they began to read 
                  up on working overseas using the computers that were scattered 
                  around the store.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">After 
                  reading many of the job applications online, Gord thought it 
                  would be best if they collectively used Gord’s resume to apply 
                  and evaluate the responses.&nbsp; It was expected that when he was 
                  declined that valuable insight would be gained into the hiring 
                  processes so that the friends who wanted to travel overseas 
                  could apply for the same jobs and have a far better chance of 
                  being accepted.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Instead, job offers flooded the inbox of Gord.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone calls 
                  and emails of “Are you Gord?&nbsp; Where’s the door?” were replaced 
                  with “Are you Gord?&nbsp; How soon can you be here?”</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">At 
                  first, Gord did not intend to take his leave of the game 
                  store.&nbsp; While he had no great desire to stay, packing up to 
                  move overseas and living in a large city didn’t exactly tempt Gord as he rather disliked living in large cities and 
                  nearly every job offer was for a city on a grand scale.&nbsp; But 
                  one offer came in that promised a working holiday at a small 
                  tourist city, and the city was remarkably close to Japan for 
                  easy traveling.&nbsp; </span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-style:italic">“Hot 
                  damn, sign me up.&nbsp; I’m on the plane that left yesterday.”</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">It 
                  was an unexpected exit opportunity from the store. Gord had 
                  long ago decided to move onto something different (such as 
                  opening up a Japanese cultural products import store or maybe 
                  a PC LAN centre) as working at a game store was only supposed 
                  to have been an experiment. &nbsp;Though now he had been presented 
                  with a job opportunity working overseas that paid good cash 
                  dollars while allowing him to be a tourist.&nbsp; The dotted line 
                  was to be signed. <br>
                  <br>
                  There was approximately one month between the time of the job 
                  offer to when Gord would have to arrive in Asia.&nbsp; Liquidating 
                  a store with a few thousand items with online auctions and 
                  in-store sales in 30 days could be done, but not without great 
                  effort and a possibly reduced sleeping schedule. While Gord 
                  prepared for this epic task, the one who would later become 
                  known as The Guardian stepped forward with an offer. He would 
                  run the store in Gord's absence for the year.&nbsp; Run, nay!&nbsp; 
                  Instead he would build the finest game store the world had 
                  ever seen and would ever see again. His vision appeared sound 
                  in concept, and should he fail there would be no harm as Gord 
                  was going to close and liquidate the store anyway.&nbsp; A plan 
                  with no drawbacks!<br>
                  <br>
                  A month later Gord walked through the door on his right.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Upon Gord's arrival in Asia, he was whisked off to a faraway 
                  city. It was as though he had arrived in another world, 
                  perhaps this was because he had arrived on the far side of the 
                  world which was quite different than what he was used to.&nbsp; 
                  While up was up and left remained left, it was still a magical 
                  land of mystery and surprise. One of Gord’s first purchases 
                  was a mountain bike, and with that he set out to explore his 
                  new world around him. Through the forests he rode and along 
                  rice paddy walls he balanced. He embraced his new world and 
                  sought to learn all he could about it.&nbsp; It was a peaceful time 
                  without concern that did not embrace him during the time he 
                  ran his store.<br>
                  <br>
                  But the chaos that embraced Gord at the World Renowned Game 
                  Store of the Future would not sit idle while Gord was absent. 
                  Even from across the world, Gord would once again be embraced 
                  by the chaos he sought to avoid and thought to be behind him.<br>
