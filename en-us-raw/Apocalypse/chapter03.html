                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">The 
                  plan was simple. &nbsp;First, stop all payments of rent to create a 
                  paper trailing showing that rent money was no longer being 
                  paid.&nbsp; After a period of time, declare that Gord had abandoned 
                  the store.&nbsp; Once the store had been declared abandoned, the 
                  store could be seized by the Landlord, and ownership of 
                  everything could be turned over to The Guardian and his 
                  assistant.&nbsp; In turn, they would sign a new lease and pay a 
                  bounty for having the entire store sold to them for a fraction 
                  of its cost to replace.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">But 
                  to orchestrate such a conspiracy it would require complete 
                  non-communication with Gord. How to shut off the complete flow 
                  of information to Gord?&nbsp; Enter the wall of silence. </span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">As 
                  Gord was pretty busy with his bike-riding adventures overseas 
                  coupled with a 16 hour time zone difference, the wall of 
                  silence involving communication with the store went unnoticed 
                  for many days.&nbsp; Weeks infact.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Severing contact with Gord was not the only step.&nbsp; A secondary 
                  wall of silence was put into play to cut off regulars who 
                  visited the store and could remain in contact with Gord.&nbsp; The 
                  end result was hoped to be that no one would wish to speak to 
                  Gord &nbsp;to prevent their plans for conquest from being 
                  compromised.&nbsp; This plan was done in two parts.&nbsp; The first part 
                  consisted of tales spun under various claims with the hope 
                  that while highly improbable individually on their own merits, 
                  the sheer number should overwhelm logic and reason. </span>

                    the video game industry and exactly what tiny percentage of

                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">As 
                  the Assistant was an imposing man, few sought to voice a 
                  contrary opinion in a scenario they knew little of.&nbsp; Those who 
                  accepted the claims were welcomed into the new order and 
                  rewarded with all that the game store could offer them.&nbsp; Those 
                  who thought differently and may remain in contact with Gord 
                  were cast out and cut off from the new order.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">As 
                  part of their plan, they anticipated that Gord would certainly 
                  bring down a world of pain onto their conspiracy once they 
                  executed their power play to grab the store.&nbsp; Gord, having 
                  never lost a court case and sporting a moderately impressive 
                  legal track record outside the courts, would be formidable in 
                  the legal arena.&nbsp; A contingency plan was formed:&nbsp; Not content 
                  in stealing everything in the store, they would make an 
                  attempt for all of Gord’s cash reserves.&nbsp; The theory being 
                  that if they could seize those, it would heavily limit Gord’s 
                  options in bringing in outside assistance such as lawyers, 
                  hired force, or possibly even returning from Asia in any sort 
                  of a timely manner.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">The 
                  cries for help went out to Gord.&nbsp; “The store is dying!” “We 
                  aren’t making any money” “The end is near!”.&nbsp; Gord would be 
                  told claims from The Guardian of how the store was generating 
                  revenue at less than 20% of what was expected, but others who 
                  had remained in contact with Gord spoke of how the store was 
                  very busy due to seasonal shopping and of course the return of 
                  people who didn’t like Gord because Gord didn’t like them.&nbsp; 
                  Two very contradictory sides were being spoken.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">Gord 
                  believed that while saving the store would have been nice, it 
                  was not of any great disappointment should it be forced to 
                  close.&nbsp; But Gord thought that it would be in the greater 
                  interest of the big picture for of him to offer up a financial 
                  bailout to The Guardian.&nbsp; Gord picked up the phone and 
                  proceeded to call the store to inform The Guardian that a gift 
                  of several thousand dollars would be brought by the store in a 
                  few days.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">The 
                  phone number to the store was disconnected.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Unable to reach the Guardian at home either, Gord phoned the 
                  phone company to find out what was occurring.&nbsp; Gord was told 
                  that he had requested the phone number be disconnected.&nbsp; Gord 
                  found it unlikely that he had ordered the phone number be 
                  disconnected as generally that is something one would remember 
                  doing.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">To 
                  the computer!&nbsp; To contact The Guardian!&nbsp; But he was offline.&nbsp; 
                  Gord pulled up the list of people on his instant message 
                  programs who had frequented the store.&nbsp; Most were offline or 
                  away.&nbsp; Of the few that were online and lived near the store, 
                  mysteriously they did not reply or suddenly had to leave when 
                  messaged.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Finally, Gord spoke with one of the old regulars who had 
                  recently moved away from the area.&nbsp; He wasn’t party to the 
                  “wall of silence” and spoke openly of what he saw.&nbsp; He noted 
                  that The Guardian had gotten a new phone number, renamed the 
                  store, claimed the store was quite busy, and was under the 
                  impression Gord knew this already as The Assistant was going 
                  to great lengths to tell everyone about how he was going to 
                  take everything of Gord’s and make it his.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">The 
                  next morning Gord did manage to contact The Guardian at home 
                  and asked what was going on.&nbsp; When asked why the number had 
                  been changed, The Guardian said it seemed like a good idea.&nbsp; A 
                  good idea to cut off most of the customer base by changing the 
                  phone number?&nbsp; Unlikely thought Gord.&nbsp; It appeared to Gord 
                  that the story of The Guardian and The Assistant making a move 
                  to steal everything may be true.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">Gord 
                  made another call.&nbsp; He called in an accountant and a person 
                  who was granted a limited power of attorney.&nbsp; He requested 
                  they go down to the store immediately and uncover what was 
                  going on.&nbsp; Things were not adding up in any sort of positive 
                  manner.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">A few 
                  hours later they arrived at the store shortly after it opened 
                  for the day.&nbsp; When faced with a sudden inspection, the 
                  Assistant borrowed directly from the handbook of evil and 
                  spoke openly of the plans to take everything from Gord.&nbsp; He 
                  spoke openly because he claimed it was far too late for Gord 
                  to stop their grand plan!&nbsp; But in the spirit of fair play, he 
                  offered a bribe of a few thousand dollars in exchange for them 
                  not telling Gord of the plan.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">They 
                  declined the money and spoke to Gord about the plan to take 
                  everything.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">While 
                  it was discouraging to learn that the Guardian had fallen to 
                  the side of darkness, Gord did not let this slow down the 
                  movement towards ending this conspiracy.&nbsp; The decision was 
                  quickly made that a scorched earth plan of execution would be 
                  implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp; The world renowned game store of the future was 
                  entering the twilight of its existence.</span></p>
