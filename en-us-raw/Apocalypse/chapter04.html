                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">To 
                  seize the store, the Guardian, the Assistant, and the Landlord 
                  Agent would have to proceed through the Landlord Agent’s 
                  employer’s office to get a court order under the claim that 
                  the game store had been abandoned.&nbsp; Unfortunate for the 
                  conspiracy crew, this particular business was owned by a 
                  personal friend of the family of Gord and was fully versed on 
                  Gord’s overseas adventures.&nbsp; But rather than let tip that the 
                  “Hand of Gord” was about to be brought down on everyone 
                  involved, instead a fallacy was told to the Landlord Agent 
                  which consisted of claims that outside persons were interested 
                  in buying out the assets of the business and taking over 
                  operation of the game store.&nbsp; Of course, this was of great 
                  news to her as it meant that she could make more money for the 
                  same work.&nbsp; </span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">A 
                  meeting for scheduled for six days to set the pricing and 
                  other terms.&nbsp; But this meeting would never occur.&nbsp; Four days 
                  later, under the cover of darkness a squad of five arrived at 
                  the store to seize and remove all that was Gord’s.&nbsp; Surprising 
                  no one, the locks had been changed.&nbsp; This was expected, and 
                  one of the five enlisted was a licensed locksmith who quickly 
                  removed the locking mechanism on the door.&nbsp; </span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">With 
                  the lock having been changed, it was thought to be probable 
                  that the security system codes had also been changed.&nbsp; Gord, 
                  while viewing it unlikely that the Guardian would turn against 
                  him, had prepared for such an eventuality.&nbsp; A backup code had 
                  been programmed into the security system.&nbsp; But had this 
                  clandestine code been discovered, Gord had also explained how 
                  to completely disable the security system.&nbsp; The door was 
                  opened, and the security timer began counting down.&nbsp; To their 
                  places the squad members ran to, preparing to forcibly 
                  terminate the security system should the code not work. &nbsp;</span></p>

                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">But 
                  such work was not needed, the backup code worked.</span></p>

                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">The 
                  stripping of the store began.&nbsp; The games, the shelves, the 
                  computers, everything.&nbsp; Into boxes it all went.&nbsp; And into the 
                  window went paper to obstruct the view of the unfolding event, 
                  as well as a sign that said “closed for taking inventory”.&nbsp; 
                  How true the sign was.</span></p>

                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
                  Sadly, the box of Gord’s personal items kept in storage at the 
                  back of the store containing many personal items such as rare 
                  games he wanted kept safe for personal use had been looted, 
                  and much of what was not of retail value had been thrown out. 
                  &nbsp;Though the Virtual Boys that sat watching ever vigilant over 
                  the store were unharmed.</span></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">
                  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">Over 
                  several hours the store was stripped nearly bare.&nbsp; The 
                  recovery mission was a success and away went the crew with 
                  Gord’s assets once again safely in Gord’s custody. </span></p>

                  the 4<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the world 
                  renowned game store of the future, it entered into the long 
                  night.&nbsp; All that remained was a now empty shell.&nbsp; It died as 
                  it began, embraced by chaos.</span></p>
