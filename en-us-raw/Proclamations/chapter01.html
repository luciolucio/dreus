                  Prophecy has been brought to us!&nbsp; First, the original 
                  scripture has been found proclaiming the future of the Xbox! 
                  And the prophecies have come true!&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  <a href="http://www.actsofgord.com/page46.html">
                  www.actsofgord.com/page46.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  <p>And now, the GameCube Prophecy!&nbsp; So it is written....&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>(Pretty much final version.&nbsp; Less hostile, more facts)<p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So, GameCube. It's here. It's pretty. $98 million in total 
                  sales from <br>
                  Sunday and before. That includes everything (systems, games, 
                  accessories) <br>
                  that sold on Sunday, that shipped from online retailers on 
                  Friday to <br>
                  customers for delivery on Monday, and units sold to rental 
                  chains like <br>
                  Blockbuster who received some 30,000 units last week. What the 
                  hell <br>
                  happened? Contrary to popular mythology, that is not really 
                  stellar.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Dreamcast had a better launch at $150 million in the 
                  opening salvo. <br>
                  Nintendo 64, about the same. PS2, around $300 million. Wow, 
                  the GameCube did $98 million. That's before you factor in that 
                  the GameCube had more units available than both, and was 
                  launching at the busiest shopping period of the year.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nintendo announced that there were to be 700,000 Gamecube's 
                  available at launch for anyone who wanted one. But supply far 
                  exceeded demand for this launch. Less than a 50% sell through 
                  on the opening salvo. Good news if you want a GameCube as you 
                  get them pretty much anywhere, not so good news when you're 
                  trying to release a system and not have it killed by the PS2 
                  as this industry is momentum based.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then you factor in that the GameCube launch was the result of 
                  2 years of <br>
                  announcements, 1 year of promises, 6 months of endless 
                  screenshots and media coverage, 3 months of magazine and 
                  in-store advertising, one month of television advertising, and 
                  everything else that goes along with the finest <br>
                  promotion that $50 million can buy. Things starts to look 
                  really bleak.<br>
                  <br>
                  When you factor that in, suddenly that $98 million starts 
                  looking really, <br>
                  really small.<br>
                  <br>
                  Last week, over a half billion dollars worth of new consoles 
                  and games sold in the world had the word &quot;PlayStation&quot; stamped 
                  on them.<br>
                  <br>
                  Putting things in perspective certainly changes things.<br>
                  <br>
                  Before we continue, let's clear up a few items. For those of 
                  you who know me, I am Gord and need no further introduction. 
                  For those of you who don't know me, you'll need an 
                  introduction.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am Gord.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is not an article to debate the merits of the GameCube 
                  and whether you should as an individual buy one. Quite 
                  frankly, I don't care. I'm a person who owns a TurboDuo just 
                  in case one day I come across a copy of Panic Bomber and I own 
                  a Genesis CDX just because it's smaller than a Genesis even 
                  though I have no Sega CD games in my personal collection. 
                  Rather this is an essay to discuss the survivability, 
                  marketability, and long term software development of the 
                  Gamecube.<br>
                  <br>
                  In reading this, undoubtedly many people will disagree with 
                  much that is <br>
                  said. Sadly, this industry has some of the finest propaganda 
                  and urban <br>
                  myths known to man. What's made worse is that many of these 
                  ideas are <br>
                  driven into us before adulthood. It's never nice to look back 
                  and go <br>
                  &quot;everything I learned as a child is a lie!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  No amount of playing games will make you an expert in the 
                  field of video <br>
                  game retail. This is one thing that escape many people. If 
                  anyone could <br>
                  run a video game company, video game retail stores wouldn't 
                  have a 95%+ <br>
                  failure in the first year, and Sega (which produces some of 
                  the finest games <br>
                  in the world) wouldn't have lost money for 5 straight years. 
                  Try getting a loan from a bank to open a game store, they'll 
                  pretty much just laugh at you and say they've never loaned 
                  money to a profitable one yet.&nbsp; Riding in a
                  plane doesn't make you a pilot, driving a car won't qualify to 
                  run GM, and <br>
                  being able to order off a menu won't qualify you to get on 
                  Iron Chef.<br>
                  <br>
                  This essay is written with regards to financial end of things. 
                  Video game <br>
                  companies aren't here just to make people happy. They are here 
                  to make <br>
                  money. If they aren't making money on a particular console, 
                  they move to <br>
                  where they believe the money is.<br>
                  <br>
                  But this does not exclude you from debating ideas and 
                  possibilities. Remember that when I say something that you 
                  disagree with, my position is of someone who probably knows a 
                  lot more than you.<br>
                  <br>
                  So unless you own your own store, or sport an MBA in marketing 
                  and have direct video game experience, you know as much about 
                  this industry as I do talking about making spacecraft. Sure, I 
                  know some of theory, but I sure as hell couldn't build one.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you buy video games, you are the result of marketing, not 
                  the student.<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, GameCube. What does it's future look like.<br>
                  <br>
                  Before we even get into the merits of what the system offers, 
                  let's look at <br>
                  the market it's entering.<br>
                  <br>
                  The home console market is absolutely dominated by Sony. The 
                  hard hard facts are that in the last 34 months, Sony has had 
                  an over 90% market share on home console hardware sales, and 
                  95% on software total software sales for home consoles have 
                  been on a PlayStation console. That means everyone else is in 
                  the &quot;other&quot; category on the pie chart.<br>
                  <br>
                  The PlayStation brand alone has outsold the NES, SNES, N64 and 
                  GameCube unit sales combined! That is no small number, and it 
                  was done in the span of seven years compared to Nintendo in 
                  seventeen years. Next, there have been more games sold with 
                  under the PlayStation banner than the rest of video game sales 
                  in history combined!<br>
                  <br>
                  (edit: Many people have emailed me and spoken of a list from 
                  Edge Magazine that claims the NES sold 62 million units 
                  worldwide. Nintendo's own published figures claims 33.7 
                  million world wide (source: www.icwwhen.com ), not inclusive 
                  of Japan's 1988 sales (estimated to be between 4-5 million) 
                  and worldwide sales in 1993 and and 1994 of less than a 
                  million. That brings the total to around 40 million. A far cry 
                  less than 62 million. Anyway, I've fired off a note to 
                  Nintendo do get some figures from them.)<br>
                  <br>
                  (edit: SNES sales. The last number I could find regarding SNES 
                  unit sales <br>
                  was 36 million when they launched the redesigned unit. At this 
                  point the <br>
                  SNES was a non-contender in the market and didn't rack up more 
                  than a few million in sales before it ceased to be. 40 million 
                  units maybe. Same <br>
                  story, I've emailed Nintendo to get sales figures.)<br>
                  <br>
                  Further, the PS2 is the fastest selling home console ever. 
                  It's past 22 <br>
                  million units sold worldwide, and it has only been outside of 
                  Japan for a <br>
                  year. The Genesis in it's glorious 6 year run only sold 21 
                  million. The <br>
                  Dreamcast? 7 million before Sega pulled the plug on it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Further more, the PS2 has set TEN monthly sales records. Every 
                  month of this year, it has broken the previously existing 
                  record for system sales. And <br>
                  this during the &quot;quiet&quot; time.<br>
                  <br>
                  So what does all this mean? It means the GameCube has some 
                  very serious <br>
                  obstacles to hurdle.<br>
                  <br>
                  First, the problems.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is a Sony industry. Everyone knows Sony, everyone loves 
                  Sony, Sony is the ticket to the fun. Whatever you may think of 
                  the PlayStation and PS2, it owns this industry. The GameCube 
                  not only has to prove why you should buy it, but also why you 
                  should NOT buy a PS2. And that's not even considering the Xbox 
                  factor.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the last console generation (circa 1995 to 2000), nearly 
                  90% of consumers bought one console. ONE CONSOLE! That is the 
                  market. The theory that people will buy two consoles is a lie. 
                  And the overwhelming majority of people who bought two 
                  consoles were N64 owners migrating over the PS1. Nearly one 
                  half of the people who bought at N64 between 1996 and 2000 
                  also bought a PS1.<br>
                  <br>
                  Obviously this is going to cause some claims of &quot;lies!&quot; so 
                  let's do the math.<br>
                  <br>
                  To date, Sony has sold nearly 100,000,000 PS1's. That's a lot. 
                  And for the <br>
                  sake of the argument, we'll pretend Nintendo sold nearly 30 
                  million N64's <br>
                  (though sales data suggests between 20 to 24 million, but who 
                  cares). So, <br>
                  assuming every N64 owner also bought a PS1, that means 70% of 
                  the market bought ONE console. One console. Just one.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, obviously this didn't happen. Somewhere near half of N64 
                  owners bought a PS1. Now, so we have 15 million N64 owners who 
                  remained exclusive, and 15 million who were multi-console (and 
                  15 of the 100 million PS1 owners).<br>
                  <br>
                  So, you've got 85 million PS1's who belong to one system 
                  owners, and 15 <br>
                  million N64's who belong to one system owners. That's, well, 
                  100 million. <br>
                  Add in the 15 million owners who bought multi-systems, and 
                  there you are at a market peak of 115 million users.<br>
                  <br>
                  Basic math shows that 87% of owners owned one system.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now knowing this, the market has shown that the overwhelming 
                  majority of <br>
                  them will be owners that will only buy one system. The market 
                  has also said <br>
                  &quot;Yes, we love the PS2&quot; so that makes the GameCube crippled out 
                  of the gate. If the market was not happy with the PS2, things 
                  would look better for the GameCube.<p>Trying to sell a product 
                  the public does not want when in their mind a current product 
                  on the market is better and offers more is a very uphill 
                  battle.<br>
                  <br>
                  Next, never has a system sold well that was less powerful than 
                  what came out before it. Never. Ever. Not once. In fact, one 
                  could argue it is retarded <br>
                  that a company would release a system that offers less than 
                  what came about before. Well, guess what boys and girls, 
                  that's exactly what the GameCube is. Even Nintendo says &quot;it's 
                  less powerful than the PS2.&quot; Here is an exact quote:<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Instead of going for the highest possible performance, which 
                  does not <br>
                  contribute to software development, our idea was to create a
                  <br>
                  developer-friendly next generation TV game machine that 
                  maintained <br>
                  above-standard capabilities.&quot; - Nintendo<br>
                  <br>
                  Why did this happen? Because prior to Sony showing up, 
                  everyone just bought the parts off the shelf and built their 
                  own machine. Everyone was on a level playing field. Everyone 
                  was happy.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sony shows up and says &quot;Hey, I've got a better idea. How about 
                  I just make everything in the machine instead?&quot; and designs a 
                  super console from the ground up. There is no way to compete 
                  with that short of doing the same. Nintendo would have to 
                  spend every penny they've got to match Sony's R&amp;D and 
                  manufacturing facilities, so that isn't really an option. So 
                  go with Plan B, do enough to get by.<br>
                  <br>
                  The GameCube is no slouch. The GameCube is a lot easier to <br>
                  make games I am told by developers who contact me, but the 
                  Xbox is the <br>
                  easiest to deal with of all the three current consoles<br>
                  <br>
                  If you believe that the GameCube is more powerful than the 
                  PS2, please note that you have been lied to. Welcome to the 
                  world of PR.<br>
                  <br>
                  The hard facts: Nintendo claims the GameCube can do 12 million 
                  polygons a second peak performance. That's pretty nice. Sega 
                  claims that Virtua <br>
                  Fighter 4 runs at 63 million polygons a second on the PS2. 
                  That's where you have someone remind you that you're drooling. <p>
                  <i>(edit: As this seems to be the most disputed part of the 
                  essay, I contacted a few programmers who are actually working 
                  on the GameCube.&nbsp; The consensus was that the GameCube is 
                  easier to make better looking games on in a short time, but if 
                  given longer the PS2 would outperform it.&nbsp; Another point 
                  raised was that the GameCube has 24MB of RAM that can easily 
                  be used for program data.&nbsp; The rest is reserved for audio 
                  and is too slow to be used for anything useful.&nbsp; They 
                  would like to send out a big thank-you to Nintendo on that 
                  complete lack of foresight.)</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Next up, developer support.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Dreamcast had more developer support. The N64 had more 
                  developer <br>
                  support. The Saturn had more developer support. The Bandia 
                  Wonderswan might even have more developer support. The 
                  GameCube is the least supported system since the Virtual Boy. 
                  While everyone is making PS2 games, and a lot of people are 
                  making one Xbox game in cases it takes off, Gamecube support 
                  is very much in the minority.<br>
                  <br>
                  The public does NOT buy a system unless they feel it will give 
                  them lots of <br>
                  new games down the road. Look at MS. They are screaming &quot;Xbox 
                  has <br>
                  developers! Honest! More than we can fit into a bus!&quot; which is 
                  the right <br>
                  approach. Joe Average will NOT buy a system if he feels that 
                  there won't be lots of new stuff coming out. And Nintendo 
                  burned a lot of bridges with <br>
                  their barren N64 release schedule for good games. They need to 
                  come out and say &quot;hey! Hundreds of games are coming out!&quot; 
                  except that would be a lie.<br>
                  <br>
                  A quick peak over to GameSpot to sneak a peak at the previews. 
                  After you remove the previews for games already out, you come 
                  up with the following:<br>
                  <br>
                  GameCube has around 60 titles previewed.<br>
                  Xbox was around 140 previewed.<br>
                  PlayStation2 has more than 300 previewed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Well, that's a lot. And that doesn't even factor in the sheer 
                  number of PS2 <br>
                  games that will only be available in Japan and weren't in the 
                  list.&nbsp; Nintendo's website lists some 100+ games to be 
                  coming out, but GameSpot doesn't count a preview as &quot;this game 
                  was announced.&quot;&nbsp; It's safe to expect that all the 
                  consoles have a lot more games in development that were not 
                  listed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nintendo's plan is to go with fewer games. Uhm, ok. And they 
                  plan to be the biggest developer on the GameCube. When you're 
                  making nearly 100% of the money on a game sold, it's easier to 
                  remain profitable. Assuming the system sells.<br>
                  <br>
                  The GameCube launch in Japan. Call it what you want, say 
                  anything nice you can. In the non-sugar coated version, the 
                  GameCube imploded on the launch pad.<br>
                  <br>
                  After the first week of sales, it sold less than 140,000 units 
                  out of nearly <br>
                  500,000. Imagine walking into a movie theatre on opening night 
                  to see the <br>
                  latest blockbuster movie that everyone was talking about, only 
                  you get there <br>
                  and all of three people in their seats when the movie starts. 
                  To date, the <br>
                  GameCube still hasn't broke 300,000 units sold in Japan. Go 
                  team Nintendo. On or about November 17, Nintendo issued a 
                  statement that they had shipped a grand total of 510,000 
                  GameCube's in Japan. An entire 60,000 extra units since it 
                  launched. That just screams trouble.<br>
                  <br>
                  On top of that, sales for the third party titles were abysmal. 
                  At least in <br>
                  the early days of the N64, anything that said &quot;64&quot; sold by the 
                  truckload as <br>
                  everyone thought they would all be as good as Mario64. So 
                  developers kept thumping out games. Granted, they mostly 
                  sucked, but the masses bought them in hopes of another 
                  Mario64.<br>
                  <br>
                  Publishers are around to do two things. Sell games and make 
                  money. Not one or the other. It's both. As soon as they aren't 
                  doing either on a console, <br>
                  they move on. The complete lack of software sales on the 
                  GameCube (outside of Luigi) has raised a lot of eyebrows. The 
                  hope that the few people who bought the system would buy many 
                  games has evaporated. On the PS2, they know they will 
                  accidentally sell games by the truckload. On the GameCube, 
                  it's looking very hopeless.<br>
                  <br>
                  Not only did the system not sell as expected, but it had the 
                  lowest level of <br>
                  software purchases with a major system launch EVER (outside of 
                  the N64 where you had a choice of Mario and Pilotwings). In 
                  Japan it launched with <br>
                  software selling at 1.3 titles per system on average. That's 
                  pretty weak. <br>
                  The U.S. launch wasn't much better, at 1.7 titles per system.<br>
                  <br>
                  And if you were a third party developer, you'd notice that 
                  third party games on the GameCube have not been selling. A 
                  better metaphor would be to say that the third party titles 
                  have been murdered and left for dead on the shelves. It's been 
                  all Luigi and Rogue Squadron that's been selling. The beauty 
                  that is Super Monkey Ball sits at the stores unloved, and for 
                  that I shed a tear.<br>
                  <br>
                  Important note: The average game has a very limited shelf at 
                  full retail. More than half of a games sales will be had 
                  within 21 days of it reaching the distribution channels. There 
                  is no &quot;sales might pick up later&quot; for most games. With 3rd 
                  party titles having a very visible lack of sales, that cuts 
                  right into future developments.<br>
                  <br>
                  Fifa for the GameCube in Japan went on sale a couple weeks ago 
                  and racked up 4,400 copies sold in the first week. Odds on 
                  favorite it won't pass 10,000 at full price. That gives EA a 
                  grand total of about $250,000 total in profit assuming 10,000 
                  copies sell. Factor in advertising, promotion, and the costs 
                  in producing the games and you just know EA is going <br>
                  &quot;well, we just lost money.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Fifa at 4,400 copies was the top selling third party GameCube 
                  game from November 12-18 in Japan. Konami's soccer title on 
                  the PS2 during the same time sold 11,000 copies bringing it's 
                  sales total up to more than 50,000 copies. That is what gets 
                  noticed. PS2 games sell, GameCube games don't. (source: 
                  Dengenki Sale Charts)&nbsp; If you were a publisher, where 
                  would you publish your games?&nbsp; The consoles where you 
                  will lose money, or the one where money is there waiting to be 
                  spent?<br>
                  <br>
                  Culture note: The 2002 Fifa world tournament is being held in 
                  Korea and Japan next year and Fifa interest is very high at 
                  the moment.<p>And with the lack of a GameCube market in Japan 
                  that is buying third-party games, that means third party games 
                  will greatly slow down in both development and release.&nbsp; 
                  And by will, I mean already has.&nbsp; Then the trickle down 
                  affect occurs as fewer Japanese games get released here.&nbsp; 
                  And companies here know there is less of a market for their 
                  games in Japan and becomes a factor in deciding how much spend 
                  on making the game.<br>
                  <br>
                  The mass market will not buy a system unless they know it's 
                  getting lots of <br>
                  games in the future. Period end. The theory that &quot;as long as 
                  it has good <br>
                  games now&quot; is a lie. Good games now get the interest, and the 
                  mass market <br>
                  needs to know more is coming out to commit to purchase. 
                  Otherwise, it's not worth paying much for the system.<br>
                  <br>
                  The mass market has shown it cares not for the GameCube. For 
                  it to sell in any serious numbers, Nintendo is going to have 
                  to do something very creative in it's marketing. The current 
                  plan is not working.<br>
                  <br>
                  Inertia:<br>
                  <br>
                  This is a money industry. Consumers go where the games are, 
                  publishers go where the consumers are. Right now, consumers 
                  are in Camp Sony. Camp Sony is huge. Camp Sony is growing at 2 
                  million new members a month.<br>
                  <br>
                  Camp Nintendo is producing less than 500,000 GameCube's a 
                  month. Camp Nintendo is less than 4% of Sony's size. The Japan 
                  model shows that GameCube failed to slow down PS2 sales there 
                  after it's release. That would be safe to say the same thing 
                  will happen here.<br>
                  <br>
                  Right now everyone is making more PS2 games than GameCube 
                  games. And by simply looking at these numbers, they will 
                  continue to make more PS2 than GameCube games. Shifting to 
                  exclusive GameCube support is financial suicide for a 
                  publisher. While Nintendo will undoubtedly use their support 
                  and money to gain some exclusives (i.e.: Resident Evil), it 
                  won't matter. It won't be enough to sustain the machine. It 
                  will garnish some sales and some attention, but it won't 
                  change the market (the Dreamcast had an exclusive Resident 
                  Evil that was for the time THE best looking game on the 
                  market).<br>
                  <br>
                  At this point, it's called inertia. The market will continue 
                  to support the <br>
                  dominant console simply because it has the most to offer. The 
                  GameCube <br>
                  doesn't offer any appreciable advantage over the PS2, and it's 
                  software <br>
                  seletion will always be lacking. It would be very inconvenient 
                  for <br>
                  consumers to choose the GameCube over the PS2.<br>
                  <br>
                  Assuming the impossible, the market said &quot;Damn it, we love 
                  Rogue Squadron and little monkeys!&quot; and completely stopped 
                  buying PS2's, there would be no market left by the time the 
                  GameCube hit critical mass. Assuming Nintendo were to 
                  immediately double production to one million a month and then 
                  began a scaled increase each month, it would be 2003 before we 
                  saw enough units to sustain the market.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the meantime, this industry would collapse. There would be 
                  nothing left <br>
                  but Nintendo. Imagine if you ran a business, and then suddenly 
                  had to run <br>
                  it with 4% of the business you had before? It just isn't going 
                  to happen.<br>
                  <br>
                  As such, developers will continue to make PS2 games. The PS2 
                  could turn out to be a tool of the devil, and they would still 
                  make most of their games on it. It's the only way to survive.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nintendo needs to focus on becoming &quot;the great second console&quot; 
                  or target the child's market which they are good at. But the 
                  mini-DVD's are hardly child friendly, and this does not help 
                  Nintendo's cause in targeting this demographic.<br>
                  <br>
                  Conclusion:<br>
                  <br>
                  Perhaps a better example would be to look at the Dreamcast. It 
                  had a <br>
                  slightly better launch, for the time it had a hell of a lot 
                  better games, a <br>
                  distinct graphical advantage, and it sold about the same 
                  number of units to <br>
                  begin with. And it had to deal with Sony.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sega produces a lot of good games. And I'm not talking 
                  publishes like <br>
                  Nintendo (where Nintendo now outsources most of their games 
                  that they <br>
                  publish), they actually write their own games on the most 
                  part. And Sega <br>
                  targeted the largest demographic group that purchases video 
                  games with their games (males 16-24),<br>
                  <br>
                  And in the end, the Dreamcast failed to become an economically 
                  viable <br>
                  machine. It had the games, it had the power. It didn't have 
                  the consumers <br>
                  willing to keep buying games. The machines are now sitting on 
                  shelves for <br>
                  $50. And yet they still don't sell!<br>
                  <br>
                  This is the fate of the GameCube.<br>
                  <br>
                  If all it took to be a successful console was a nice price and 
                  some nice <br>
                  games, we would all own Dreamcasts.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the end will it outsell the Xbox? Not a clue. Will anyone 
                  care in a <br>
                  year? Only the zealots.<br>
                  <br>
                  Even Nintendo is saying their main money maker for the next 
                  several years <br>
                  will be the GameBoy Advance, and that the majority of their 
                  resources will <br>
                  be poured into that.<br>
                  <br>
                  Even Nintendo doesn't believe the GameCube will be #1 when 
                  it's all over.<br>
                  <br>
                  And the final question:<br>
                  <br>
                  Should you buy a GameCube? Hey, it's your money. Just make 
                  sure you're <br>
                  buying it to play what's out now, as it's long term viability 
                  is highly suspect. In every respect the Dreamcast was a better 
                  contender, and it's now sitting on store shelves with a $50 
                  price tag and a little note saying &quot;please love me.&quot;<br>
