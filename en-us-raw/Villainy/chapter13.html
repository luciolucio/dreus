                  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;My friend returned some games to your 
                  store though the return slot last night that were to have been 
                  returned to Microplay.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&quot;The only returns I had this morning 
                  were mine.&nbsp; Maybe five games total.&nbsp; And all in my 
                  cases.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Just give me back the game.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;I would if I had any idea what you were talking about.&nbsp; 
                  I get games from other stores occasionally, and I just have 
                  them returned to those stores. Last night I had not such 
                  product.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Why are you trying to steal the game!&nbsp; It was an 
                  accident!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Trust me, I've got better things to do than steal games 
                  scratched to hell from Microplay that are covered in their 
                  stickers and have no box.&nbsp; What would I get?&nbsp; $5 if 
                  I was really lucky?&nbsp; That hardly justifies that risk of 
                  selling what I know is not mine.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;It was Gran Turismo 3!&nbsp; You can get a lot for that 
                  game!&nbsp; And I will have to pay Microplay $90 if I don't 
                  bring it back.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Gran Turismo 3?&nbsp; For the PS2?&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Yes, now give it back!&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Now I know definitely that I do not have it.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;If you don't give it back, you'll have to give me a new 
                  copy or I'll phone the cops!&nbsp; What you're doing is 
                  illegal.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Your mastery of the legal system humbles my mighty 
                  efforts.&nbsp; You are truly the master of all matters legal.&nbsp; 
                  I humbly cast myself before you and ask that you not pursue 
                  such an action.&nbsp; Let us work together to resolve this 
                  incident.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;You're going to give me the game?&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Yes, I'm going to give you a sealed copy.&nbsp; But 
                  I'll need your name and phone number.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Because Gran Turismo 3 isn't out yet.&nbsp; It won't be 
                  out for another two weeks.&nbsp; It was delayed by a month.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&lt;dramatic pause&gt;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Uhm....&nbsp; it's out.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;No, no it's not.&nbsp; And when that magical copy that 
                  does not exist showed up, I had to create a shrine for it in 
                  the back.&nbsp; But the shrine is invisible.&nbsp; If you look 
                  right there, you can almost see it if you believe.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&quot;Ah.....&nbsp; errr....&quot;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Now, I cannot touch the shrine for the gods will strike 
                  me down.&nbsp; Let us call the police and they shall remove 
                  the game from the shrine.&nbsp; Would you like to call, or 
                  should I?&nbsp; For only they have the power remove the game 
                  from the shrine.&quot;</i></p>
                  <p>&lt;dramatic pause&gt;</p>
                  <p><i>&quot;Might I suggest next time you try using this plan to 
                  steal a game, you use a game that is actually out?&nbsp; I 
                  would suspect it would work much better.&quot;</i></p>
