                  A quiet weekday night at the store.&nbsp; Gord was there late 
                  and was partaking of some StarCraft with a friend of his in 
                  Japan.&nbsp; The recent purchase of a headset proved to be 
                  very interesting as it was considerably easier than typing.<p>
                  But eventually, the friend in Japan had to depart for two 
                  hours.&nbsp; Until then, Gord would have to amuse himself in 
                  the game store after hours.</p>
                  <p>Sadly, at the same moment the friend departed, Babylon 5 
                  ended as well.&nbsp; In it's place began a particularly bad 
                  episode of Star Trek Voyager.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>Gord, in a valiant fight to save his soul, turned off the 
                  TV and sat on one of the couches in the back.</p>
                  <p>&quot;Hmm.... What to do.&nbsp; I could play a PlayStation game, 
                  maybe some more StarCraft.&nbsp; Or I could just sit here on 
                  the comfy couch for two hours in complete darkness trying not 
                  to fall asleep.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Several seconds later....</p>
                  <p>&quot;zzzzzz&quot;</p>
                  <p>....two hours later....</p>
                  <p>'zzzzz.... StarCraft....zzzzz...&nbsp; Yes sir!.... 
                  zzzz....&nbsp; your forces are under attack.... zzzz....&nbsp; 
                  as ordered... zzz... BAM BAM:</p>
                  <p>Gord wakes from his sitting slumber.</p>
                  <p>&quot;wah?&nbsp; StarCraft doesn't go Bam&quot;</p>
                  <p>&lt;BAM BAM BAM&gt;</p>
                  <p>&quot;What the?&nbsp; Sounds like that sound is coming next 
                  door.&nbsp; What would the dance hall be doing at... err....&nbsp; 
                  what the hell time is it!&nbsp; Where's a clock!&nbsp; Damn 
                  it, I can't see.&quot;</p>
                  <p>&lt;BAM BAM BAM&gt;</p>
                  <p>&quot;That sounds like it's coming right from the very back of 
                  the store.&nbsp; That's odd.&nbsp; Where's a clock!&quot;</p>
                  <p>Gord was still in very much a groggy state.</p>
                  <p>&lt;BAM CRASH TINKLE&gt;</p>
                  <p>&quot;I should NOT be able to hear a tinkle through those walls.&nbsp; 
                  That is coming from the back.&quot; </p>
                  <p>Gord jumps to his feet.&nbsp; And reaches a curious 
                  conclusion.&nbsp; The crashing in the back must be someone he 
                  knows who he is storing stuff for in the back, and must be 
                  sorting it, even though he doesn't have a key to the business.</p>
                  <p>&quot;That had DAMN WELL better be YOU Brendan!&quot;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Oh shit!&quot;</p>
                  <p>&lt;clang&gt;</p>
                  <p>&lt;stomp stomp stomp&gt;</p>
                  <p>&lt;Slam&gt;</p>
                  <p>&lt;Voooooooom!&gt;</p>
                  <p>&lt;Screech!&gt;</p>
                  <p>&quot;Uhm.... crap.&nbsp; Guess it wasn't.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Gord investigates the back and conducts a quick 
                  investigation.&nbsp; The thieves broke into the utility room 
                  of the building by prying the door open, and once in there 
                  were hammering away through the wall.&nbsp; Seems the cement 
                  walls of the store only went between the stores, and along the 
                  outside.&nbsp; The utility room was technically part of Gord's 
                  store on the original building design.</p>
                  <p>So with this design flaw, they were hammering through the 
                  wall.&nbsp; They had created a rather sizeable hole in the 
                  wall.&nbsp; Sadly, they had not looked in the back room before 
                  they did this, or they would have noticed it was full of boxes 
                  being stored for people.&nbsp; There was no way to get into 
                  the room from that wall.</p>
                  <p>When they fled the scene, they left behind the tools of the 
                  crime.&nbsp; Gord made a profit!</p>
                  <p>In the end, a short blurb on it made the local paper 
                  followed by the national papers the next day as a curious 
                  little story.</td>
