                  <font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Sadly the live thief bait 
                  program worked a little too well and for the longest time no 
                  one dared to try and steal the overpriced crap N64 games like 
                  Wayne Gretzky's hockey.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then one day, one dared to steal from the Gord!<br>
                  <br>
                  So our beloved thief decided to make his move at lunch time 
                  when the store is quite busy.&nbsp; Right to the N64 games he goes 
                  and stuffs his jeans with crap games.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Gord laughs at the amateur and waves at him.<br>
                  <br>
                  The would be thief then begins to walk around the store 
                  to look at all the pretty cases.&nbsp; Eventually he winds his way 
                  over to the anime which is next to the counter.&nbsp; Gord takes 
                  this opportunity to speak up and say hi.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;So Steve, you like N64 games?&quot; </i>spoke Gord as he tapped 
                  his jeans to show he knew buddy had stuffed games into his 
                  pockets.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;What?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You like N64 games?&quot; </i>spoke the Gord as again he 
                  slapped his jeans in the same spots the thief had placed the 
                  stolen games on his person.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Uhm...ya….&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  And at this time buddy walked back to the shelf where the 
                  games were from and stood there.&nbsp; The Gord assumed he was 
                  going to put them back since he was caught.<br>
                  <br>
                  Instead, he took all the games remaining and made a bolt for 
                  the door and to freedom!&nbsp; Down the street he was gone.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Well, I'm out $8.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  A brief inquiry as to where buddy lived was fruitless.&nbsp; Then 
                  it dawned on the Gord to see if buddy had an account at the 
                  store.<br>
                  <br>
                  And low and behold, there he did.&nbsp; So Gord phoned up the 
                  police and sent them over.&nbsp; The games were recovered and buddy 
                  went to jail.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sadly he made no offer to pay the huge prices on the games, so 
                  instead Gord only got his crap games back and a story to tell 
                  the masses.</font></td>
