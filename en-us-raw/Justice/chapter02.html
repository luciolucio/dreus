                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Yes, my name is Trevor Evans, and I just got a note from your 
                  collection company.&nbsp; Why is that?!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Well, my theory would be that it would be because you owe 
                  me money.&nbsp; But if you would like me to confirm, I could check 
                  my records.&nbsp; What is your phone number and I'll check.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  Gord pulls up his account and it turns out Mr. Evans here owes 
                  him $41 in late charges (he only ever spent $6 in the store in 
                  rentals in the first place), and never rented again. After six 
                  months, accounts owing more than $20 are forwarded to 
                  collections.&nbsp; Gord explained all this to him.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Late fees are illegal!&nbsp; You can't charge them if you are a 
                  retail establishment!&nbsp; I know the law!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Apparently you failed that class.&nbsp; You were advised when 
                  you signed up that games returned late would incur a charge of 
                  $1 per day.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;That's illegal.&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;Just because you say so doesn't make it true.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Don't you know who I am?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Yes, you would be Trevor Evans.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;You don't know who I am, do you?!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You're not Trevor Evans?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;You have no idea at all who I am!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;You would be the guy that owes me $41 in late fees and 
                  apparently failed law class.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'll get my Lawyer after you!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;I'll save him the call.&nbsp; What's his name and number?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;I'm not telling you his name.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Did he fail his law class too?&nbsp; I hope not.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;You'll have to sue me if you ever want your money.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Ok.&nbsp; Normally I wait a year before filing any sort of legal 
                  action on unpaid debts, but if you want I can file that on 
                  Monday.&nbsp; In hindsight, that was a pretty stupid threat as now 
                  you've got everything happening faster.&nbsp; But then, you're 
                  you.&nbsp; Have a nice day. <br>
