                          <i>&quot;Mike, this is Gord from Gamer's Edge.&nbsp; I'm phoning 
                          in regards to the status of your account.&nbsp; 
                          Specifically your son Justin who ran up over $200 in 
                          late charges that have never been paid.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;WHAT?!&nbsp; How did that happen?!?&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Well, he kept out a PlayStation and three games 
                          for more than two months.&nbsp; I talked to both you 
                          and Justin a few times and I was told by both of you that it 
                          would be paid for in full when it was returned.&nbsp; I 
                          gave you guys the monthly rate.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;I don't have an account there!&nbsp; My son owes for his 
                          own bills, and you should have known better than to 
                          rent to him!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Actually, you do have an account here.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's your 
                          account.&nbsp; You signed it up so he could rent machines.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;No I don't.&nbsp; You're just saying that so I'll pay his 
                          bill.&nbsp; I'm never paying it!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Seriously, it's your account.&nbsp; I have your drivers 
                          license and SIN # on file.&nbsp; If it goes to collections 
                          it's a guaranteed hit on your credit file.&nbsp; There is 
                          no mistake here.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;I'm not paying for my son's bills.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;Actually, they are your bills.&nbsp; You agreed to pay 
                          any charges he incurs.&nbsp; We talked about this when you 
                          set your account up.&nbsp; It was your account, and Justin 
                          could use it.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;I don't have an account there.&nbsp; I've never been to 
                          your store!&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          <i>&quot;We covered that already.&nbsp; Mike, look, just come 
                          down and make an offer on this.&nbsp; I can understand 
                          you're pissed at what your son did.&nbsp; Hell, if I 
                          charged you the full rate of $7 a day for the games 
                          and system, it would be over $400.&nbsp; I'm not being a 
                          Nazi here, just come down and set up to pay maybe $150 
                          and we'll call it done.&quot;</i><br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;I'm never paying!&quot; and then he hung up.&nbsp; Tsk.<br>
                          <br>
                          So it was Gord's fault here, apparently.&nbsp; Anyway, this 
                          was forwarded to collections and the collection 
                          company got a few phone calls from a couple banks 
                          regarding it.&nbsp; Don't know if Mike ever got his loans 
                          he was trying to get, but given that there was more 
                          than one call, it would suggest he didn't.&nbsp; :)<br>
