                  <font face="Times New Roman">So back in the day Gran Turismo 
                  was 'da bomb' and everyone wanted it.&nbsp; With eight copies, it 
                  was a huge rental.&nbsp; Anyway, one of the copies got stolen in 
                  October.<br>
                  <br>
                  So the Gord opens a new copy and it is rented to a new 
                  account.<br>
                  <br>
                  Game comes back looking like it was carved and used to serve 
                  drinks on.&nbsp; Here are the main conversational points from the 
                  conversations...<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Conversation one&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;That CD was like that when we got it.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;No, no it wasn't.&nbsp; You were the first ones to rent it.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Oh, well my husband will be in to pay for it.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Conversation two&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm not paying for the game unless I can keep the game!&nbsp; I 
                  want to make sure you aren't making this up!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Sure.&nbsp; You can have it.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Oh, well my husband will be in to pay for it.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &lt;Conversation three&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm not paying for the game unless I can keep the games AND 
                  the case!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Sure.&nbsp; You can have them both.&nbsp; They're sitting in a 
                  drawer.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &lt;Conversation four&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;First you said the game was wrecked, and now you say it 
                  doesn't work!&nbsp; Why are you exaggerating the damage?!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ma'am, you destroyed the game.&nbsp; You owe for the game.&nbsp; End 
                  of story.&nbsp; I'm sorry if my choice of adjectives is 
                  confusing.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;If you ever want your money, you'll have to sue.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Fine.&nbsp; I'll get the paperwork in order and filed.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;We'll see you in court!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Ok.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;What?&nbsp; You can't sue!&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>&quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &quot;Because… because…&quot;<br>
                  <i><br>
                  &quot;I see you've put a lot of thought into this plan.&quot;<br>
                  </i><br>
                  &lt;click&gt;<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, two days later I get a wonderfully handcrafted letter 
                  from her that would put a six year old to shame if they wrote 
                  it.&nbsp; My god, it was one giant paragraph explaining why she was 
                  right and I was wrong.&nbsp; I will find this letter and scan it 
                  for so you can see it.&nbsp; It was truly god awful.<br>
                  <br>
                  And the Gord did what he does best, he wrote back.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>&quot;I have received your letter dated June 14, 1999.&nbsp; In this 
                  letter, besides highlighting your apparent third grade writing 
                  level, you deny any liability on your part for the damage done 
                  to the game (Gran Turismo) that you rented.&quot;<br>
                  </b><br>
                  You can just imagine the rest….&nbsp; Thus spoke the Gord!</font></td>
